              <h2>Easy Access to Debugging Information</h2>

              <p>
                Whenever an application is behaving in an incorrect or unexpected manner, it is
                important to be able to quickly analyze the behavior and determine the source of
                the problem.  For applications that use an API for communicating with a directory
                server, it is important for that API to provide adequate debugging information to
                help determine where the cause of the problem might exist.

              <h3>JNDI Debugging Capabilities</h3>

              <p>
                JNDI appears to provide the following support for debugging:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <tt>com.sun.jndi.ldap.trace.ber</tt> property can be set with a value that is
                  an <tt>OutputStream</tt> object in the initial environment properties used when
                  creating a connection.  If this is done, then JNDI will write hexadecimal dumps
                  of all ASN.1 BER data to that output stream.  This will happen for the duration
                  of the connection, and it cannot be enabled or disabled during the life of the
                  connection.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The <tt>com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.debug</tt> property can be set with a
                  value of either "fine" or "all" in order to enable debugging of information
                  related to connection pooling.  It appears that this debug information would be
                  written using the Java logging framework.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                There does not appear to be any other mechanism for accessing debug information in
                JNDI.
              </p>

              <h3>Netscape Directory SDK for Java Debugging Capabilities</h3>

              <p>
                The Netscape Directory SDK for Java provides the following support for debugging:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The "<tt>debug</tt>" property can be set to "true" using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnection.setProperty</tt> method (and presumably as a system property)
                  to enable debugging, in which case a small set of messages will be written to
                  standard output.  There are very few things that can generate debug messages in
                  the SDK, and it is not possible to specify an alternate location for this debug
                  information.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  The "<tt>com.netscape.ldap.trace</tt>" property can be set to either a
                  <tt>PrintWriter</tt> or <tt>LDAPTraceWriter</tt> object using the
                  <tt>LDAPConnection.setProperty</tt> method.  If this is done, then messages will
                  be written to the provided writer for key events like establishing connections,
                  sending requests, and reading responses.  It appears that it is possible to
                  specify this as a system property with no value in order to cause this
                  information to be written to standard error.

              <h3>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java Debugging Capabilities</h3>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides significant access to debugging
                information.  The types of debug information that can be generated include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Information about LDAP messages read from or written to a directory server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about ASN.1 elements read from or written to a directory server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about connection establishment and termination.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about entries and change records read from and written to LDIF.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about exceptions caught within the SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about monitor entry parsing.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information about coding errors and other incorrect uses of the LDAP SDK.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Each of these types of debugging can be enabled or disabled individually, and
                debugging can be configured either programmatically or using system properties.
                Debug messages are handled using the Java logging framework.
              </p>
