  hidden on the source server (e.g., using the subtree-accessibility tool), \
  make the subtree accessible on the target server, delete all entries from \
  the subtree in the source server, and make the subtree accessible on the \
  source server.  To revert the move, use the same process but swap the \
  source and target servers.

  accessible on the target server, but is currently hidden on the source \
  server and may contain one or more of the original entries.  To complete \

  failed or was interrupted during the process of copying entries from the \
  source server into the target server.
ERR_MOVE_SUBTREE_POSSIBLY_INTERRUPTED_IN_ADDS_ADMIN_MSG=In order to restore \

  accessible on source server {1}:{2,number,0} and/or target server \
  {3}:{4,number,0} as required by the move-subtree tool.  {5}  This may be \
  the result of a previous move-subtree attempt that failed or was \
