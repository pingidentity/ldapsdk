INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_TOOL_DESC=Retrieve or update information about the current \
  state of a user account.  Processing will be performed using the password \
  policy state extended operation, and you must have the password-reset \
  privilege to use this extended operation.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_GROUP_TARGET_USER_ARGS=Arguments for Identifying Target \
  Users
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_GROUP_PERFORMANCE=Arguments for Adjusting Performance
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_DN=The DN of the user entry on which to \
  operate.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple \
  user DNs.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_DN_FILE=The path to a file containing the DNs of \
  the user entries on which to operate.  The DN file must contain one DN per \
  line, and blank lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be \
  ignored.  This argument may be provided multiple times to use multiple DN \
  files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_FILTER=An LDAP filter that may be used to \
  identify the user entries on which to operate.  The {0} argument may be \
  used to specify the base DN for the search.  This argument may be provided \
  multiple times to specify multiple target filters.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_FILTER_INPUT_FILE=The path to a file containing a \
  set of LDAP filters to use to identify the user entries on which to \
  operate.  The {0} argument may be used to specify the base DN for the \
  searches.  The filter file must contain one filter per line, and blank \
  lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be ignored.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to use multiple filter files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_USER_ID=A string that identifies a user on \
  which to operate.  The tool will search for the user with a base DN \
  specified by the {0} argument and a user ID attribute specified by the {1} \
  argument.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple \
  target user IDs.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_USER_ID_INPUT_FILE=The path to a file containing a \
  set of user ID values.  The file must contain one user ID per line, and \
  blank lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be ignored.  The \
  tool will search for the users with a base DN specified by the {0} argument \
  and a user ID attribute specified by the {1} argument.  This argument may \
  be provided multiple times to use multiple user ID files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_USER_ID_ATTR=The name or OID of the attribute used \
  to identify users with IDs specified using the {0} and {1} arguments.  If \
  this argument is not provided, a default user ID attribute of {2} will be \
  used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_BASE_DN=The base DN to use when searching for user \
  entries when using any of the {0}, {1}, {2}, or {3} arguments.  If this \
  argument is not provided, the default base DN will be the null DN.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_SIMPLE_PAGE_SIZE=Indicates that any searches \
  performed to identify which users to target should make use of the simple \
  paged results control to cause the entries to be returned in sets of no \
  more than the specified number of entries.  When processing searches that \
  may return a large number of entries, setting a page size can help reduce \
  the likelihood that the server will need to block while sending results \
  to the client if matching entries are identified much more quickly than \
  the client can process the desired {0} operations against those entries.  \
  Further, when performing searches that may return a large number of \
  entries, and especially for unindexed searches, setting a page size can \
  help the client more efficiently resume processing in the event that the \
  connection used to process the search becomes unusable.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_NUM_THREADS=The number of concurrent threads to use \
  when performing {0} operations against user entries.  If this argument is \
  not provided, a default value of one will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_NUM_SEARCH_THREADS=The number of concurrent threads \
  to use when searching for entries to target with {0} operations.  This will \
  only be used if arguments are provided that require the tool to perform \
  searches to identify which entries to target (and will primarily be useful \
  only in cases in which there will be multiple searches, as when reading \
  filters or user IDs from a file).  If this argument is not provided, a \
  default value of one will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_RATE_PER_SECOND=The maximum rate, in operations per \
  second, at which to target user entries.  If neither this nor the {0} \
  argument is provided, then the tool will not perform any rate limiting.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_VARIABLE_RATE_DATA=The path to a file containing a \
  variable rate definition that may be used to cause the tool to vary the \
  amount of load it generates over time.  If neither this nor the {0} \
  argument is provided, then the tool will not perform any rate limiting.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_GENERATE_SAMPLE_RATE_FILE=The path to a file to \
  create with a sample variable rate definition.  This file will contain \
  comments that describe the expected format for the file to use with the {0} \
  argument.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_REJECT_FILE=The path to a file to write with a \
  record of any unsuccessful attempts to retrieve or update account \
  information for a user.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_APPEND_TO_REJECT_FILE=Indicates that the tool \
  should append to the file specified by the {0} argument if it already \
  exists.  If this argument is not provided and the reject file already \
  exists, it will be overwritten.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_SUPPRESS_EMPTY_RESULT_OPERATIONS=Indicates that the \
  result information for each {0} operation processed should suppress \
  information about password policy state operations included in the result \
  that do not have any values.  Operations presented without values generally \
  indicated that the user''s password policy is not configured for the \
  associated functionality (e.g., if the password expiration time was \
  requested but password expiration is not enabled in the user''s password \
  policy).
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_ALL=Retrieve all available state information for \
  a user.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_GET_ALL_EXAMPLE=Retrieve all available state information \
  for user ''{0}''.

  be permitted to authenticate or be used as an alternate authorization \
  identity.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_USABILITY_NOTICES=Retrieve any password policy \
  state account usability notice messages for a user.  These messages may \
  provide useful information about the state of the user account, but do not \
  necessarily represent a current or imminent problem with the account.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_GET_USABILITY_NOTICES_EXAMPLE=Retrieve any password \
  policy state account usability notice messages for user ''{0}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_USABILITY_WARNINGS=Retrieve any password policy \

  policy state account usability warning messages for user ''{0}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_USABILITY_ERRORS=Retrieve any password policy \
  state account usability error messages for a user.  The messages may \
  provide information about conditions that prevent a user account from \
  authenticating, being used as an alternate authorization identity, or \
  otherwise functioning normally.

  generalized time form or in the local time zone using one of the following \
  formats:  YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuu, YYYYMMDDhhmmss, or YYYYMMDDhhmm.  If this \
  argument is not provided, the password changed time will be set to the \
  current time.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_SET_PW_CHANGED_TIME_EXAMPLE=Set the password changed time \
  for user ''{0}'' to ''{1}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_PW_CHANGED_TIME=Clear the password changed \
  time value for a user.  For password policy evaluations that require \
  knowing when the user''s password was last changed, the server will attempt \
  to fall back to using the create timestamp, if available.

  time for user ''{0}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_IS_DISABLED=Determine whether a user account has \
  been disabled by an administrator and cannot authenticate or be used as an \
  alternate authorization identity.  This can also be accomplished with a \
  standard LDAP search operation by determining whether the user entry has a \
  ds-pwp-account-disabled operational attribute with a value of true.

  for user ''{0}'' has been disabled by an administrator.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_SET_IS_DISABLED=Specify whether a user account is \
  administratively disabled.  A disabled account cannot authenticate or be \
  used as an alternate authorization identity.  This can also be accomplished \
  with a standard LDAP modify operation by setting the value of the \
  ds-pwp-account-disabled operational attribute in the user''s entry with a \
  value of either true or false (or by removing the attribute from the \
  user''s entry, which is equivalent to giving it a value of false).

  account administratively disabled.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_IS_DISABLED=Clear the account disabled state \
  information from a user entry, which is logically equivalent to using the \

  for a user.  If the activation time is in the future, the user cannot \
  authenticate or be used as an alternate authorization identity.  This can \
  also be accomplished with a standard LDAP modify operation by setting the \
  ds-pwp-account-activation-time attribute to have a generalized time \
  representation of the desired activation time.

  for user ''{0}'' to ''{1}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_ACCT_ACT_TIME=Clear the account activation \
  time for a user.  If the account previously had an activation time in the \
  future, this will make it immediately eligible for use.  This can also be \
  accomplished with a standard LDAP modify operation by removing the \
  ds-pwp-account-activation-time attribute from the user''s entry.

  authenticate or be used as an alternate authorization identity.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_GET_ACCT_NOT_YET_ACTIVE_EXAMPLE=Determine whether user \
  ''{0}'' has an account activation time in the future.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_ACCT_EXP_TIME=Retrieve the account expiration \
  time for a user.  If the expiration time is in the past, the user cannot \
  authenticate or be used as an alternate authorization identity.  This can \

INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_CONTROLS=Control Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_DATA=Data Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_OPS=Operation Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=Apply a set of add, delete, modify, and/or \
  modify DN operations to a directory server.  Supply the changes to apply \
  in LDIF format, either from standard input or from a file specified \
  with the ''{0}'' argument.  Change records must be separated by at least \
  one blank line.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_UNDELETE=Treat any add operation that \
  includes the ''{0}'' attribute as an undelete operation.  Undelete requests \
  may be used to restore a soft-deleted entry, optionally using a different \
  DN than was originally assigned to the entry.  The server must be \
  configured to allow soft delete operations, and the requester must have the \
  soft-delete-read privilege.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPLICATION=Indicates that all \
  operation requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary assured \
  replication request control to indicate that the server should delay \
  returning a response to the client until a minimum amount of replication \
  processing has been performed for the operation.  The ''--{0}'', ''--{1}'', \
  and ''--{2}'' arguments may be used to configure the settings to use for \
  the assured replication control, but the server will automatically \
  determine an appropriate value for any argument that is not provided.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_AUTHZ_IDENTITY=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the authorization identity request control as \
  defined in RFC 3829.  With this control, a successful bind result should \
  include the authorization identity assigned to the connection.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GENERATE_PASSWORD=Indicates that all add \
  requests should include the generate password request control to request \
  that the server generate a password for the new account.  The generated \
  password will be returned in a corresponding response control.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR=Continue processing changes \
  even if an error is encountered.  If this is not provided, then processing \
  will abort after the first failed operation.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DEFAULT_ADD=Assume that any LDIF change \
  record without a changeType represents an add operation.  If this is not \
  provided, then any change record without a changeType will be considered an \
  error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DRY_RUN=Parse the LDIF representations of the \
  changes to apply but don''t actually perform any LDAP communication.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FOLLOW_REFERRALS=Attempt to follow any \
  referrals encountered while processing changes.  If this is not provided, \
  then any referral received will be considered an error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTR=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get authorization \
  entry request control to request that the server return the specified \
  attribute (or collection of attributes, in the case of a special identifier \
  like ''*'' to indicate all user attributes or ''+'' to indicate all \
  operational attributes) from the authenticated user''s entry.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to \
  request.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_BACKEND_SET_ID=Indicates that all \
  add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests should include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get backend set ID request control to request that \
  the Directory Proxy Server include a corresponding get backend set ID \
  response control in each operation response, indicating the entry-balancing \
  backend set in which the write was processed.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_RECENT_LOGIN_HISTORY=Indicates that all \
  bind requests should include the get recent login history request control \
  to request that the server include a corresponding response control with \
  information about the user''s recent login history.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_SERVER_ID=Indicates that all add, delete \
  modify, and modify DN requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary \
  get server ID request control to request that server include a \
  corresponding get server ID response control in each operation response, \
  indicating the server in which the write was processed.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS=Indicates that all \
  bind requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get user resource \
  limits request control to request that the server return information \
  about resource limits (e.g., size limit, time limit, idle time limit, etc.) \
  imposed for the user.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_HARD_DELETE=Indicates that all delete \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary hard delete request \
  control, which will permanently delete the target entry even if the \
  server would have otherwise performed a soft delete operation to hide the \
  entry for a period of time before deleting it.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_IGNORE_NO_USER_MOD=Indicates that all add \
  and modify requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary ignore \
  NO-USER-MODIFICATION request control to permit setting values for certain \
  operational attributes not normally permitted to be provided by external \
  clients.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_VERSION=Specifies the LDAP protocol \
  version that the tool should use when communicating with the directory \
  server.  This argument has no effect and is provided only for the purpose \
  of compatibility with other ldapmodify tools.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Indicates that all \
  requests should include the manageDsaIT request control to indicate that \
  referral entries should be treated as regular entries.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_NAME_WITH_ENTRY_UUID=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary name with entryUUID request control in all add \
  requests sent to the server to indicate that the server should use the \
  entryUUID operational attribute as the naming attribute for the resulting \
  entry instead of the provided RDN.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESC_NEVER_RETRY=Indicates that the tool should not \
  attempt to retry operations that fail in a way that the connection to \
  the directory server may be invalid.  By default, it will automatically \
  try to establish a new connection and retry the failed operation.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_NO_OPERATION=Include the LDAP no-operation \
  control in all add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests sent to the \
  server to indicate that the operation should be validated but no changes \
  should actually be applied.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PASSWORD_POLICY=Indicates that all add, bind \
  and modify requests should include the password policy request control \
  (as defined in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-10) to request that the \
  response include password policy-related information about the target entry.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_EQUALS_VALUE='{'name=value'}'
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PW_UPDATE_BEHAVIOR=Specifies that all add and \
  modify requests should include the password update behavior request control \
  with the specified behavior.  Values for this argument must be in the form \
  ''name=value'', where the property name can be any of the following:  \
  is-self-change, allow-pre-encoded-password, skip-password-validation, \
  ignore-password-history, ignore-minimum-password-age, \
  password-storage-scheme, and must-change-password.  The value for each \
  property should be either ''true'' or ''false'', with the exception of the \
  password-storage-scheme property, whose value should be the name of the \
  desired password storage scheme.  This argument can be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple password update behaviors.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PASSWORD_VALIDATION_DETAILS=Indicates that \
  all add and modify requests that target either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' \
  attribute should include the UnboundID-proprietary password validation \
  details request control to indicate that the response should include \
  information about the password quality requirements that the server will \
  impose for the target user''s password and whether the provided password \
  satisfies each of those constraints.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERMISSIVE_MODIFY=Indicates that all modify \
  operation requests should include the permissive modify request control, \
  which indicates that the server should be more lenient for certain \
  types of changes (e.g., trying to add an attribute value that already \
  exists, or trying to remove a value that does not exist) that would \
  normally cause the modify operation to be rejected.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PURGE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Indicates that any \
  modify operation that targets either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' attribute \
  should include the UnboundID-proprietary purge current password request \
  control.  This will indicate that the server should could purge the \
  current password from the entry (even if it would have otherwise been \
  retired for a brief period of time).
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REPLICATION_REPAIR=Indicates that all \
  operation requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary replication \
  repair request control.  This will cause the change to be applied only to \
  the target directory server instance but not to any other server in the \
  replication topology.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETIRE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Indicates that any \
  modify operation that targets either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' attribute \
  should include the UnboundID-proprietary retire current password \
  request control.  This will indicate that the server should continue to \
  allow the user to authenticate with their current password (in addition to \
  the new password) for a brief period of time.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETRY_FAILED_OPERATIONS=Indicates that, if an \
  operation fails in a way that indicates the connection to the server may no \
  longer be valid, the tool should automatically create a new connection and \
  re-try the operation before reporting it as a failure.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ROUTE_TO_BACKEND_SET=\
  '{'entry-balancing-processor-id:backend-set-id'}'
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ROUTE_TO_BACKEND_SET=Specifies the ID of an \
  entry-balancing backend set to which the Directory Proxy Server should \
  send all of the add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests.  The value \
  should be formatted as the entry-balancing request processor ID followed by \
  a colon and the desired backend set ID for that entry-balancing request \
  processor.  This argument can be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple backend set IDs for the same or different entry-balancing request \
  processors.  The request control will be configured to use absolute routing \
  rather than a routing hint.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ROUTE_TO_SERVER='{'id'}'
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ROUTE_TO_SERVER=Specifies the ID of the \
  backend server to which the Directory Proxy Server should send all add, \
  delete, modify, and modify DN requests.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the tool \
  should operate in script-friendly mode.  This argument has no effect and is \
  provided only for the purpose of compatibility with other ldapmodify tools.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SOFT_DELETE=Indicates that all delete \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary soft delete request \
  control, which indicates that the server should hide the entry for a \
  period of time before deleting it so that it may be restored with an \
  undelete operation if the delete should be reverted.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Indicates that the tool \
  should strip any illegal trailing spaces from LDIF records before \
  attempting to process them.  If this is not provided, then any LDIF record \
  with one or more illegal trailing spaces will be considered an error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_CLIENT_SIDE_SUBTREE_DELETE=Indicates that all \
  delete requests should be processed as client-side subtree deletes by \
  searching for all entries below the target entry and then deleting them.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SERVER_SIDE_SUBTREE_DELETE=Indicates that all \
  delete requests should be processed as server-side subtree deletes using \
  the subtree delete request control.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_REFERINT_UPDATES=Indicates that the \
  tool should include the UnboundID-proprietary suppress referential \
  integrity updates request control in all delete and modify DN operations \
  to indicate that the server should not perform any referential integrity \
  processing for those operations.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Indicates that the tool \
  should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations \
  using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying \
  to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal \
  worker threads are busy processing other requests.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_TRANSACTION=Indicates that the server \
  should create a transaction to process all operations as a single atomic \
  unit.  This should generally only be used with a relatively small number of \
  changes, and it is recommended that the changes be supplied in an LDIF file \
  rather than via standard input.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPL_TIMEOUT=Specifies the timeout to \
  use for assured replication processing.  This should only be used if the \
  ''{0}'' argument is also provided.  If assured replication is to be used \
  but this argument is not provided, then the server will automatically \
  determine the timeout to use.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_ATTR=Indicates that all add, modify, \
  and modify DN requests should include a uniqueness request control that \
  indicates that the server should attempt to prevent the requested operation \
  from introducing a conflict with the same value in an existing entry.  This \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple unique attribute types, \
  and in that case the ''--uniquenessMultipleAttributeBehavior'' argument may \
  be used to specify the behavior to exhibit for conflicts across those \
  attribute types.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_FILTER=Indicates that all add, modify \
  and modify DN requests should include a uniqueness request control that \
  indicates that the server should attempt to prevent the requested \
  operation from introducing a conflict with other entries matching the \
  provided filter.  If the ''--uniquenessAttribute'' argument is provided, \
  then this filter will be used to narrow the set of potentially conflicting \
  entries to only those that also match this filter.  If the \
  ''--uniquenessAttribute'' argument is not provided, then the server will \
  consider it a conflict if any other entry matches the provided filter.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_BASE_DN=Specifies the base DN that \
  should be included in the uniqueness request control.  This can only be \
  used if at least one of the ''--uniquenessAttribute'' or \
  ''--uniquenessFilter'' arguments is provided.  If this is not given, the \
  server will look for uniqueness conflicts within all public naming contexts.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_BEHAVIOR='{'behavior'}'
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_MULTIPLE_ATTRIBUTE_BEHAVIOR=Specifies \
  the behavior that the server should exhibit if the multiple unique \

  argument are ''unique-within-each-attribute'' (to indicate that each \
  attribute should be considered separately), \
  ''unique-across-all-attributes-including-in-same-entry'' (to indicate that \
  the value of one unique attribute cannot also be present in the value of \
  any other unique attributes, even if the conflicting values are in the same \
  entry), ''unique-across-all-attributes-except-in-same-entry'' (to indicate \
  that the value of one unique attribute cannot also be present in the value \
  of any other unique attribute, although the same entry will be permitted to \
  have the same value in multiple attributes), or ''unique-in-combination'' \
  (to indicate that no other entry will be permitted to have the same \
  combination of unique attribute values).  If this is not specified, then a \
  default of ''unique-within-each-attribute'' will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_LEVEL='{'level'}'
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_PRE_COMMIT_LEVEL=Specifies the \
  level of pre-commit validation that should be used for the uniqueness \
  request control.  This can only be used if at least one of the \
  ''--uniquenessAttribute'' or ''--uniquenessFilter'' arguments is \
  provided.  Allowed values for this argument are ''none'' (to indicate that \
  no pre-commit validation should be performed), ''all-subtree-views'' (to \
  indicate that a minimum of one pre-commit check should be performed in each \
  applicable subtree view), ''all-backend-sets'' (to indicate that a minimum \
  of one pre-commit check should be performed in each entry-balancing backend \
  set), and ''all-available-backend-servers'' (to indicate that the \
  pre-commit check should be made in all backend servers available through \
  the Directory Proxy Server).  If this is not specified, then a default of \
  ''all-subtree-views'' will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_POST_COMMIT_LEVEL=Specifies the \
  level of post-commit validation that should be used for the uniqueness \
  request control.  This can only be used if at least one of the \
  ''--uniquenessAttribute'' or ''--uniquenessFilter'' arguments is provided.  \
  Allowed values for this argument are ''none'' (to indicate that no \
  post-commit validation should be performed), ''all-subtree-views'' (to \
  indicate that a minimum of one post-commit check should be performed in \
  each applicable subtree view), ''all-backend-sets'' (to indicate that a \
  minimum of one post-commit check should be performed in each \
  entry-balancing backend set), and ''all-available-backend-servers'' (to \
  indicate that the post-commit check should be made in all backend servers \
  available through the Directory Proxy Server).  If this is not specified, \
  then a default of ''all-subtree-views'' will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ADD_CONTROL=Specifies a control that should \

INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDIF_FILE=The path to the LDIF file \
  containing the changes to process.  If this is not provided, then the \
  changes will be read from standard input.  If this argument is provided \
  multiple times to supply multiple LDIF files, then they will be processed \
  in the order they were provided on the command line.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ENCRYPTION_PW_FILE=The path to a file that \
  contains the passphrase used to generate the key used to encrypt the LDIF \

  operations processed.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSERTION_FILTER=A filter that will be used \
  in conjunction with the LDAP assertion request control (as described in RFC \
  4528) to indicate that the server should only apply changes to entries that \
  match this filter.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MODIFY_ENTRIES_MATCHING_FILTER=Indicates that \
  the changes read from standard input or the specified LDIF file should be \
  applied to all entries that match the specified filter.  Only modify \
  operations will be processed when this argument is provided, and the DN of \
  the modify change record will be used as the base DN for the search used to \
  identify the entries to modify.  If the filter may match a large number of \
  entries, then it is strongly recommended that the {0} argument be provided \
  to process the search in batches.  This argument may be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple filters to use to search for entries to modify.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MODIFY_FILTER_FILE=Indicates that the changes \
  read from standard input or the specified LDIF file should be applied to \
  all entries that match a filter read from the specified file.  Only modify \
  operations will be processed when this argument is provided, and the DN of \
  the modify change record will be used as the base DN for the search used to \
  identify the entries to modify.  If any of the filters may match a large \
  number of entries, then it is strongly recommended that the {0} argument be \
  provided to process the search in batches.  This argument may be provided \
  multiple times to specify multiple filter files to use to search for \
  entries to modify.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MODIFY_ENTRY_DN=Indicates that the changes \
  read from standard input or the specified LDIF file should be applied to \
  the entry with the specified DN rather than the DN contained in the change \
  record.  Only modify operations will be processed when this argument is \
  provided, and it may be provided multiple times to specify the DNs of \
  multiple entries to modify.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MODIFY_DN_FILE=Indicates that the changes \
  read from standard input or the specified LDIF file should be applied to \
  the entries whose DNs are contained in the specified file rather than the \
  DN contained in the change record.  Only modify operations will be \
  processed when this argument is provided, and it may be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple DN files.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SEARCH_PAGE_SIZE=Specifies the page size to \
  use in conjunction with the simple paged results control when searching \
  for entries to modify based on the filter provided in the {0} or {1} \
  argument.  If this argument is not provided, then the simple paged results \
  control will not be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RATE_PER_SECOND=Specifies a maximum operation \
  rate that the tool should be permitted to achieve.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPL_LOCAL_LEVEL=Specifies the local \
  assurance level to use for the assured replication request control.  This \
  should only be used if the ''{0}'' argument is provided.  The value \
  should be one of ''none'', ''received-any-server'', or \
  ''processed-all-servers''.  If assured replication is to be used but this \
  argument is not provided, then the server will automatically determine the \
  local assurance level to use.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPL_REMOTE_LEVEL=Specifies the \
  remote assurance level to use for the assured replication request control.  \
  This should only be used if the ''{0}'' argument is provided.  The value \
  should be one of ''none'', ''received-any-remote-location'', \
  ''received-all-remote-locations'', or ''processed-all-remote-servers''.  If \
  assured replication is to be used but this argument is not provided, then \
  the server will automatically determine the remote assurance level to use.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OPERATION_PURPOSE=Indicates that all \
  operations should include the UnboundID-proprietary operation purpose \
  request control to provide the specified reason for the operation.

  all add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests should be sent to the \
  server in a single multi-update request with the specified error behavior.  \
  The value for this argument must be one of ''atomic'' (to indicate that all \
  updates should be processed atomically so that they will either all \
  succeed or all fail), ''abort-on-error'' (to indicate that the server \
  should only process changes until the first error is encountered and ignore \
  any remaining changes after that error), or ''continue-on-error'' (to \
  indicate that the server should continue attempting to process changes, \
  even after one of them has resulted in a failure).
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_POST_READ_ATTRIBUTE=Indicates that all \
  add, modify, and modify DN requests should include the post-read control \
  (as described in RFC 4527) to retrieve the value(s) of the specified \
  attribute as they appear immediately after the operation has been processed.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PRE_READ_ATTRIBUTE=Indicates that all delete, \
  modify, and modify DN requests should include the pre-read control (as \
  described in RFC 4527) to retrieve the value(s) of the specified attribute \
  as they appear immediately before the operation has been processed.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_AS=Indicates that all requests should \
  include the proxied authorization request control (as described in RFC \
  4370) to process the operation under an alternate authorization identity.  \
  The authorization ID should generally be specified in the form ''dn:'' \
  followed by the target user''s DN, or ''u:'' followed by the username.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_V1_AS=Indicates that all requests \

INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR=Continue processing \
  searches even if an error is encountered.  If this is not provided, then \
  processing will abort after the first failed search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_COUNT_ENTRIES=Indicates that the tool exit \
  code should represent the number of entries returned during search \
  processing.  If this is not provided, or if an error is encountered while \
  processing the search, then the tool exit code will reflect the LDAP result \
  code received during search processing (or an appropriate client-side \
  result code if a problem was encountered before sending any searches).  \
  Note that because some operating systems do not allow exit code values \
  greater than 255, that will be the maximum exit value for this tool even if \
  more than 255 entries are returned.  Also note that this argument can only \
  be used when processing a single search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_WRAP_COLUMN=The column at which long lines in \
  the LDIF representation of an entry should be wrapped.  A value of zero \
  indicates that no wrapping should be performed.  If this is not provided, \
  then the wrap column will be based on the width of the terminal used to \
  run the tool.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DONT_WRAP=Indicates that no line wrapping \
  should be performed when displaying the LDIF representations of matching \
  entries.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_BASE64_COMMENTS=Indicates that the \
  tool should not include any comments that attempt to provide a \
  human-readable representation of any base64-encoded attribute values in \
  the search results.  If this argument is not provided, then any attribute \
  value whose LDIF representation requires base64 encoding will be \
  immediately followed by a comment that attempts to provide a human-readable \
  representation of the raw bytes that comprise that base64-encoded value.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DRY_RUN=Indicate which searches would be \
  issued but do not actually send them to the server.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FOLLOW_REFERRALS=Attempt to follow any \
  referrals and search result references encountered during search \
  processing.  If this is not provided, then referrals and search references \
  will be displayed in the output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS=Indicates that all \
  bind requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get user resource \
  limits request control to request that the server return information \
  about resource limits (e.g., size limit, time limit, idle time limit, etc.) \
  imposed for the user.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_INCLUDE_REPL_CONFLICTS=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary return conflict \
  entries request control to indicate that the server may return any \
  replication conflict entries that match the search criteria.  Replication \
  conflict entries are normally excluded from search results.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_INCLUDE_SOFT_DELETED=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary soft-deleted \
  entry access request control to indicate that the server may return any \
  soft-deleted entries that match the search criteria.  Soft-deleted entries \
  are normally excluded from search results.  The value for this argument \
  must be one of:  ''with-non-deleted-entries'' (indicates that both regular \
  and soft-deleted entries should be returned), \
  ''without-non-deleted-entries'' (indicates that only soft-deleted entries \
  should be returned), or ''deleted-entries-in-undeleted-form'' (returns \
  only soft-deleted entries in the form in the form the entries had before \
  they were deleted).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_INCLUDE_DRAFT_LDUP_SUBENTRIES=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the subentries request control as \
  described in draft-ietf-ldup-subentry to indicate that the server may \
  return any LDAP subentries that match the search criteria.  LDAP subentries \
  are normally excluded from search results.  This control does not take a \
  value.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_INCLUDE_RFC_3672_SUBENTRIES=\
  '{'returnOnlySubentries'}'
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_INCLUDE_RFC_3672_SUBENTRIES=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the subentries request control as \
  described in RFC 3672 to indicate that the server may return any LDAP \
  subentries that match the search criteria, optionally including regular \
  entries along with the subentries.  LDAP subentries are normally excluded \
  from search results.  This control requires a Boolean value of either \
  ''true'' or ''false'' to indicate whether the server should return only \
  subentries (if true), or both regular entries and subentries (if false).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_RULE=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the join request control to indicate that matching entries \
  should be joined with related entries based on the specified criteria.  \
  Allowed values include ''dn:'' followed by the name of an attribute in the \
  source entry containing the DNs of the entries with which to join; \
  ''reverse-dn:'' followed by the name of an attribute in the target entries \
  whose value is the DN of the source entry; ''equals:'' followed by the \
  name of an attribute in the source entry, a colon, and the name of an \
  attribute in target entries that must exactly match the source attribute; \
  or ''contains:'' followed by the name of an attribute in the source entry, \
  a colon, and the name of an attribute in target entries that must match or \
  contain the value of the source attribute.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_BASE_DN=Specifies the base DN to use \
  for searches used to join search result entries with related entries.  \
  The value may be one of ''search-base'' to use the base DN of the search \
  request, ''source-entry-dn'' to use the DN of the source entry as the base \
  DN for join searches, or any valid LDAP DN to use a custom base DN for join \
  searches.  If this is not specified, then the default join base DN will be \
  the search base DN.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_SCOPE=Specifies the scope to use for \
  searches used to join search result entries with related entries.  The \
  value may be one of ''base'', ''one'', ''sub'', or ''subordinates''.  If \
  this is not specified, then the scope of the search request will be used as \
  the join scope.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_SIZE_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum number \
  of entries that the server will permit to be joined with any single search \
  result entry.  If this is not provided, the size limit from the search \
  request will be used.  Note that the server will impose a maximum join size \
  limit of 1000 entries, so any join size limit greater than that will be \
  limited to 1000.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_FILTER=Specifies an additional filter \
  that the server will require target entries to match in order to be joined \
  with the source entry.  If this is not provided, no additional join filter \
  will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_ATTR=Specifies an identifier that \
  indicates which attribute(s) should be included in entries joined with \
  search result entries.  The value may be an attribute name or OID, a \
  special token like ''*'' to indicate all user attributes or ''+'' to \
  indicate all operational attributes, or an object class name prefixed by an \
  ''@'' symbol to indicate all attributes associated with the specified \
  object class.  This may be provided multiple times to specify multiple \
  requested attributes.  If this is not specified, then the server will \
  behave as if all user attributes had been requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_REQUIRE_MATCH=Indicates that the server \
  should not return an entry that matches the search criteria if it is not \
  joined with at least one additional entry.  If this is not provided, then \
  entries matching the search criteria will be returned even if they are not \
  joined with any other entries.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the manageDsaIT request control to indicate that \
  any referral entries in the scope of the search should be treated as \
  regular entries rather than causing the server to send search result \
  references.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REAL_ATTRS_ONLY=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary real attributes only \
  request control to indicate that the server should not include any \
  virtual attributes in entries that are returned.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETRY_FAILED_OPERATIONS=Indicates that, if a \
  search fails in a way that indicates the connection to the server may no \
  longer be valid, the tool should automatically create a new connection and \
  re-try the search before reporting it as a failure.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the tool \
  should operate in script-friendly mode.  This argument has no effect and is \
  provided only for the purpose of compatibility with other ldapsearch tools.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SEPARATE_OUTPUT_FILES=Indicates that the tool \
  should generate a separate output file for each search rather than \
  combining all results into a single file.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TEE=Indicates that search results should be \
  written to standard output as well as to the output file specified via the \
  ''{0}'' argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Indicates that the tool \
  should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations \
  using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying \
  to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal \
  worker threads are busy processing other requests.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_OP_ATTR_UPDATES=Indicates that \
  all operations should include the UnboundID-proprietary suppress \
  operational attribute updates request control to indicate that the \
  server should not apply any updates to the specified operational \
  attributes.  The value may be one of ''last-access-time'', \
  ''last-login-time'', ''last-login-ip'', or ''lastmod''.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PASSWORD_POLICY=Indicates that bind requests \
  should include the password policy request control (as defined in \
  draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-10) to request that the response include \
  password policy-related information about the target entry.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TYPES_ONLY=Indicates that the server should \
  only include the names of the attributes contained in the entry rather than \
  both names and values.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TERSE=Indicates that the tool should generate \
  terse output.  The only thing written to standard output will be search \
  result entries and references, without any summary messages.  Standard \
  error will not be affected.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_VERBOSE=Indicates that the tool should \
  generate verbose output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_VIRTUAL_ATTRS_ONLY=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary virtual attributes \
  only request control to indicate that the server should only include \
  virtual attributes in entries that are returned.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_BIND_CONTROL=Specifies a control that should \
  be included in all bind requests used to authenticate to the server.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SEARCH_CONTROL=Specifies a control that \
  should be included in all search requests sent to the server.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_BASE_DN=Specifies the base DN that should be \
  used for the search.  If a filter file is provided, then this base DN will \
  be used for each search with a filter read from that file.  This argument \
  must not be provided if the --ldapURLFile is given.  If no base DN is \
  specified, then the null base DN will be used by default.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_EXCLUDE_BRANCH=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary exclude branch \
  request control to indicate that matching entries below the specified \
  base DN should be excluded from search results.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times if multiple branches should be excluded.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FILTER_FILE=Specifies the path to a file \
  containing the search filters to issue.  Each filter should be on a \
  separate line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with the ''#'' character \
  will be ignored.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple filter files.  If a filter file is provided, then the first \
  trailing argument will not be interpreted as a search filter (all trailing \
  arguments will be interpreted as requested attributes).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_URL_FILE=Specifies the path to a file \
  containing LDAP URLs that define the search requests to issue.  The LDAP \
  URLs will specify the base DN, scope, filter, and attributes to return for \
  each search (any hostnames and port numbers included in the URLs will be \
  ignored).  Each URL should be on a separate line.  Blank lines and lines \
  beginning with the ''#'' character will be ignored.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple LDAP URL files.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FORMAT=Specifies the format that \
  should be used for the output generated by this tool.  Allowed values are \
  ''LDIF'' (LDAP Data Interchange Format, which is the standard string \
  representation for LDAP data), ''JSON'' (JavaScript Object Notation, which \
  is a popular format used by web services), ''CSV'' (comma-separated \
  values, which is a commonly-used format for text processing, with only a \
  single value per attribute), ''multi-valued-csv'' (comma-separated values \
  with a vertical bar between values of multivalued attributes), \
  ''tab-delimited'' (another commonly-used general text format, with only a \
  single value per attribute), ''multi-valued-tab-delimited'' (tab-delimited \
  text with a vertical bar between values of multivalued attributes), \
  ''dsn-only'' (in which only the DN of each matching entry will be written \
  on a line by itself with no information about the entry''s attributes), and \
  ''values-only'' (in which each value returned will be written on a line by \
  itself with no attribute names, entry DNs, or delimiters between entries).  \
  If either the ''CSV'' or ''tab-delimited'' format is selected, the set of \
  requested attributes must be provided with the ''{0}'' argument, the order \
  in which the attributes are provided on the command line specifies the \
  order in which they will be listed in the output, and if any of those \
  attributes has multiple values then only the first value will be used.  \
  Further, the ''CSV'' and ''tab-delimited'' formats cannot be used in \
  conjunction with the ''{1}'' argument.  If no output format is specified, a \
  default of ''LDIF'' will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REQUIRE_MATCH=Indicates that {0} should \
  exit with a nonzero result code, {1}, if the search completes successfully \
  but does not return any matching entries.  This argument only affects the \
  tool exit code; it will not have any visible effect on the output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FILE=Specifies the path to the file to \
  which search results should be written.  If this argument is not provided \
  then results will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_COMPRESS_OUTPUT=Indicates that the output \
  should be gzip-compressed.  This can only be used if the --outputFile \
  argument is provided and the --teeResultsToStandardOut argument is not \
  provided.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT=Indicates that the output \
  should be encrypted with a key generated from a provided password.  This \
  can only be used if the --outputFile argument is provided and the \
  --teeResultsToStandardOut argument is not provided.  If the \
  --encryptionPassphraseFile argument is provided, then that file will be used \
  to specify the encryption passphrase; otherwise, the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ENCRYPTION_PW_FILE=The path to a file that \
  specifies the passphrase to use to encrypt the output.  This can only be \
  provided if the --encryptOutput argument is given, but if that argument is \
  given and no passphrase file is specified, then the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.  If a file is specified, then that file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line comprised entirely of the passphrase.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSERTION_FILTER=A filter that will be used \
  in conjunction with the LDAP assertion request control (as described in RFC \
  4528) to indicate that the server should only process searches in which the \
  entry specified as the base DN matches this filter.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FILTER=Specifies a filter to use when \
  processing a search.  This may be provided multiple times to issue multiple \
  searches with different filters.  If this argument is provided, then the \
  first trailing argument will not be interpreted as a search filter (all \
  trailing arguments will be interpreted as requested attributes).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MATCHED_VALUES_FILTER=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the matched values request control (as \
  described in RFC 3876) to indicate that search result entries should only \
  include values for a given attribute that match the provided filter.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple matched values \
  filters.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RATE_PER_SECOND=Specifies a maximum search \
  rate that the tool should be permitted to achieve.  Note that this limit \
  applies only to the rate at which the client issues search requests and not \
  to the rate at which the server may send matching entries.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PAGE_SIZE=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the simple paged results control (as described in RFC \
  2696) to indicate that the search should return entries in pages of no more \
  than the specified size.  This can be useful for searches that must return \
  a large number of entries but the server restricts the number of entries \
  that may be returned for any search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SIZE_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum number of \
  entries that the server should return for each search.  A value of zero \
  (which is the default if this argument is not used) indicates that no \
  client-side size limit should be imposed.  Note that the server may impose \
  its own limit on the number of entries that may be returned for a search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TIME_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum length of \
  time in seconds that the server should spend processing each search.  A \
  value of zero (which is the default if this argument is not provided) \
  indicates that no client-side time limit should be imposed.  Note that the \
  server may impose its own time limit for search requests.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCOPE=Specifies the scope that to use for \
  search requests.  The value should be one of ''base'', ''one'', ''sub'', or \
  ''subordinates''.  If this argument is not provided, a default of ''sub'' \
  will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DEREFERENCE_POLICY=Specifies the alias \
  dereferencing policy to use for search requests.  The value should be one \
  of ''never'', ''always'', ''search'', or ''find''.  If this argument is not \
  provided, a default of ''never'' will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTR=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get authorization \
  entry request control to request that the server return the specified \
  attribute (or collection of attributes, in the case of a special identifier \
  like ''*'' to indicate all user attributes or ''+'' to indicate all \
  operational attributes) from the authenticated user''s entry.  This argument \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to request.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_BACKEND_SET_ID=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get backend set \
  ID request control to request that the Directory Proxy Server include a \
  corresponding get backend set ID response control in each search result \
  entry, indicating the entry-balancing backend set from which that entry was \
  retrieved.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_RECENT_LOGIN_HISTORY=Indicates that all \
  bind requests should include the get recent login history request control \
  to request that the server include a corresponding response control with \
  information about the user''s recent login history.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_SERVER_ID=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get server ID request \
  control to request that server include a corresponding get server ID \
  response control in each search result entry, indicating the server from \
  which that entry was retrieved.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_EFFECTIVE_RIGHTS_ATTR=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get effective \
  rights request control to return information about the access control \
  rights that a user has when interacting with each matching entry.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_EFFECTIVE_RIGHTS_AUTHZID=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary get \
  effective rights request control to return information about the \
  access control rights the specified user has when interacting with each \
  matching entry.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MATCHING_ENTRY_COUNT_CONTROL=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary matching \
  entry count request control, which indicates that the server should \
  return information about the number of entries that match the search \
  criteria.  The maximum number of entries to examine must be specified, \
  which helps indicate whether an exact count or an estimate will be \
  returned.  If alwaysExamine is specified and the number of candidates is \
  less than the examine count, then each candidate will be examined to verify \
  that it matches the criteria and would actually be returned to the client \
  in a search.  If allowUnindexed is specified, then the count will be \
  allowed to be processed even if the search is unindexed (and may take a \
  very long time to complete).  If debug is specified, then additional debug \
  information may be included in the output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OPERATION_PURPOSE=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary operation purpose \
  request control to provide the specified reason for the operation.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_NAME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER='{'name=value'}'
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OVERRIDE_SEARCH_LIMIT=Indicates that search \
  operations should include the override search limits request control with \
  the specified name-value pair.  This may be provided multiple times to \
  specify multiple property name-value pairs to include in the control.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERSISTENT_SEARCH=Indicates that the search \
  request should include the persistent search request control (as described \
  in draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch) to indicate that the server should return \
  information about changes to entries that match the search criteria as \
  they are processed.  This argument may only be used when processing a \
  single search operation.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_AS=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the proxied authorization request control (as described in \
  RFC 4370) to process the operation under an alternate authorization \
  identity.  The authorization ID should generally be specified in the form \
  ''dn:'' followed by the target user''s DN, or ''u:'' followed by the username.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_V1_AS=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the legacy proxied authorization v1 request control \
  (as described in draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-04) to process the search under \
  an alternate authorization identity, specified as the DN of the desired user.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REQUESTED_ATTR=Specifies an identifier that \
  indicates which attribute(s) should be included in entries that match the \
  search criteria.  The value may be an attribute name or OID, a special \
  token like ''*'' to indicate all user attributes or ''+'' to indicate all \
  operational attributes, or an object class name prefixed by an ''@'' symbol \
  to indicate all attributes associated with the specified object class.  \
  This may be provided multiple times to specify multiple requested \
  attributes, and it may be provided instead of or in addition to the set of \
  requested attributes in the set of trailing arguments.  If this is not \
  specified, then the server will behave as if all user attributes had been \
  requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ROUTE_TO_BACKEND_SET=\
  '{'entry-balancing-processor-id:backend-set-id'}'
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ROUTE_TO_BACKEND_SET=Specifies the ID of an \
  entry-balancing backend set to which the Directory Proxy Server should \
  send all of the search requests.  The value should be formatted as the \
  entry-balancing request processor ID followed by a colon and the desired \
  backend set ID for that entry-balancing request processor.  This argument \
  can be provided multiple times to specify multiple backend set IDs for the \
  same or different entry-balancing request processors.  The request control \
  will be configured to use absolute routing rather than a routing hint.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ROUTE_TO_SERVER='{'id'}'
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ROUTE_TO_SERVER=Specifies the ID of the \
  backend server to which the Directory Proxy Server should send all search \
  requests.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SORT_ORDER=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the server-side sort request control (as described in RFC \
  2891) to request that the server sort results before returning them to the \
  client.  The sort order should be a comma-separated list of attribute \
  names, each of which may be optionally prefixed by ''+'' (to indicate that \
  sorting should be in ascending order for that attribute) or ''-'' (for \
  descending order), and may be optionally followed by a colon and the name \
  or OID for the ordering matching rule that should be used when sorting.  \
  Ascending order will be used if neither ''+'' or ''-'' is specified, and if \
  no matching rule ID is given then the attribute type''s own ordering rule \
  will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_VLV=Indicates that all search requests should \
  include the virtual list view (VLV) request control (as described in \
  draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv) to indicate that the server should return \
  the specified subset of the sorted search results (and the ''{0}'' argument \
  must also be given to specify the sort order).  The value should be a \
  colon-delimited list indicating which page of results to return, and it may \
  take one of two forms.  In either case, the first element specifies the \
  number of elements to return before the entry identified as the start of \
  the results, and the second is the number of entries after the ''start'' \
  entry.  The third element identifies the start of the result set, and it \
  may be either an integer offset (in which the first entry in the result \
  set has an offset of one), or a string that provides a value for which the \
  server should identify the first entry whose value for the primary sort \
  attribute is greater than or equal to the given string.  In the event that \
  an offset is provided, a fourth element must also be given to indicate the \
  expected number of entries in the result set, or zero if that is not \
  known.  For example, a value of ''0:9:1:0'' indicates that the server \
  should return the first ten entries of the result set (starting at offset \
  1, which is the first entry, return the zero previous entries and the nine \
  following entries, with no indication of how many entries match the search \
  criteria).  Alternately, a value of ''0:99:smith'' indicates that the \
  server should the first 100 entries in the result set for which the primary \
  sort attribute has a value that is greater than or equal to ''smith''.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REJECT_UNINDEXED_SEARCH=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary reject unindexed \
  search request control to indicate that the server should not process the \
  search operation if it cannot do so efficiently using server indexes, even \
  if the requester has the unindexed-search privilege.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERMIT_UNINDEXED_SEARCH=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary permit unindexed \
  search request control to indicate that the server should process the \
  search operation even if it cannot do so efficiently using server indexes.  \
  The requester must have either the unindexed-search or \
  unindexed-search-with-control privilege.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_EXCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID \
  of an attribute that should be excluded from search result entries.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to \
  exclude.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REDACT_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID of \
  an attribute whose values should be redacted to indicate that the attribute \
  is present in search result entries but to hide the actual values for that \
  attribute.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple attributes to redact.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_HIDE_REDACTED_VALUE_COUNT=Indicates that the \
  output should not reveal the number of values contained in redacted \
  attributes.  If this argument is present, then a redacted attribute will \
  only ever have a single value of ''***REDACTED***''.  If this argument is \
  not present, then a redacted attribute with multiple values will still have \
  the same number of values that it originally had, but those values will \
  be ''***REDACTED1***'', ''***REDACTED2***'', etc.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID \
  of an attribute whose values should be scrambled.  Scrambling will be \
  performed in a manner that attempts to preserve the associated attribute \
  syntax and that will generally try to ensure that a given input value will \
  consistently yield the same scrambled output.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to scramble.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_JSON_FIELD=Specifies the name of a \
  JSON field whose values should be scrambled.  If the --scrambleAttribute \
  argument is used to scramble any attributes whose values may be JSON \
  objects, then all JSON field names will be preserved and only the values of \
  the specified fields will be scrambled.  If this argument is given (and it \
  may be provided multiple times to target multiple JSON fields), then only \
  the specified fields will have their values scrambled.  If this argument \
  is not provided, then any of the scramble attribute values that are JSON \
  objects will have all values scrambled.  JSON field names will be treated \
  in a case-insensitive manner.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_RANDOM_SEED=Specifies the value that \
  will be used to seed the random number generator used in the course of \
  scrambling attribute values.  If a random seed is provided, then scrambling \
  the same entry with the same seed should consistently yield the same \
  scrambled representations.  If no random seed is specified, an appropriate \
  value will be selected automatically.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RENAME_ATTRIBUTE_FROM=Specifies the name or \
  OID of an attribute that should have its name replaced with the value \
  specified in the --renameAttributeTo argument.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times as long as the --renameAttributeTo argument is also \
  provided the same number of times, and the order of --renameAttributeFrom \
  values must correspond to the order of --renameAttributeTo values.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RENAME_ATTRIBUTE_TO=Specifies the new name \
  to use for an attribute to be renamed.  This argument must be provided the \
  same number of times as the --renameAttributeFrom argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MOVE_SUBTREE_FROM=Specifies the base DN for \
  a subtree to be moved to another location in the DIT, with this source DN \
  being replaced with the base DN specified using the --moveSubtreeTo \
  argument.  This argument may be provided multiple times as long as the \
  --moveSubtreeTo argument is also provided the same number of times, and the \
  order of --moveSubtreeFrom values must correspond to the order of \
  --moveSubtreeTo values.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MOVE_SUBTREE_TO=Specifies the new base DN for \
  a subtree to be moved.  This argument must be provided the same number of \
  times as the --moveSubtreeFrom argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_VERSION=Specifies the LDAP protocol \
  version that the tool should use when communicating with the directory \
  server.  This argument has no effect and is provided only for the purpose \
  of compatibility with other ldapsearch tools.

ERR_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_ARGS_WITH_URL_FILE=Trailing arguments are not allowed \
  when the ''{0}'' argument is provided.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_FILTER_WITH_FILTER_FILE=If a filter file is \
  specified, then a filter cannot be provided as a trailing argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_NO_TRAILING_ARGS=If neither the ''{0}'' nor the ''{1}'' \
  argument is provided, the filter to use for the search must be provided as \
  a trailing argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_FIRST_TRAILING_ARG_NOT_FILTER=The first trailing argument \
  ''{0}'' is not a valid LDAP search filter.
WARN_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_ARG_STARTS_WITH_DASH=WARNING:  Unnamed trailing \
  argument ''{0}'' starts with a dash.  Trailing arguments should only be \
  used for the search filter (unless a different argument is used to specify \
  the filters) and set of requested attributes to include in search result \
  entries.  If this was intended to be a named argument, it should be \
  placed earlier in the argument list.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_INVALID_MATCHED_VALUES_FILTER=Filter ''{0}'' is a valid \
  search filter, but is not valid for use with the matched values request \
  control.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MATCHING_ENTRY_COUNT_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid.  The value must start with ''examineCount='' \
  followed by an integer greater than or equal to zero.  It may optionally \
  also contain '':alwaysExamine'' (to indicate that it should always attempt \
  to examine candidate entries to determine whether they actually match), \
  '':allowUnindexed'' (to indicate that the server should attempt to \
  determine the matching entry count even if the search criteria is not \
  indexed), '':skipResolvingExplodedIndexes'' (to indicate whether the server \
  should skip the effort of actually retrieving the candidate entry IDs for \
  exploded index keys in which the number of matching entries is known), \
  '':fastShortCircuitThreshold='' followed by an integer value (to specify \
  the short-circuit threshold that the server should use when determining \
  whether to continue with index processing, even if there may be additional \
  filter components that may be very fast to process), \
  '':slowShortCircuitThreshold='' followed by an integer value (to specify \
  the short-circuit threshold that should be used if it is expected that \
  there may be potentially-expensive filter components left to evaluate), \
  and/or '':debug'' (to indicate that the response control should include \
  debug information about the processing performed in the course of making \
  the determination.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_NO_EQUAL=A value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid because it does not contain an equal sign to separate \
  the property name from the value.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_EMPTY_PROPERTY_NAME=A value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid because it starts with an equal sign, \
  indicating an empty property name.  Property names must not be empty.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME=A value provided for \
  the ''{0}'' argument is invalid because there are multiple attempts to set \
  a value for property ''{1}''.  The same property cannot be set multiple \
  times.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_EMPTY_PROPERTY_VALUE=A value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid because it contains an empty value for property \
  ''{1}''.  Property values must not be empty.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_PERSISTENT_SEARCH_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid.  The value must start with ''ps''.  That may \
  be followed by a colon and a comma-delimited list of change types (''add'', \
  ''delete'', ''modify'', or ''modifydn''), or ''any'' to indicate that all \
  change types should be included.  That may be followed by a colon and a \
  ''1'' to indicate that the search should only return matching entries when \
  they are argeted by an appropriate operation, or ''0'' to indicate that the \
  search should first return all existing entries that match the criteria \
  before transitioning to returning to returning entries as updates occur.  \
  That may be followed by a colon and a ''1'' to request that the server \
  include entry change notification controls with search result entries, or \
  ''0'' to request no such controls.  A value of just ''ps'' is equivalent \
  to ''ps:any:1:1''.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_SORT_ORDER_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value must be a comma-delimited list of one or \
  more attribute names or OIDs, each of which may be prefixed by ''-'' to \
  indicate that sorting for that attribute should be in descending order, or \
  ''+'' to indicate that sorting for that attribute should be in ascending \
  order.  If an attribute name is not prefixed with either ''-'' or ''+'', \
  then sorting for that attribute will be in ascending order.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_VLV_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' argument \
  is invalid.  The value must either be a colon-delimited list of four \
  integers (representing the before count; after count; offset index; and \
  expected result set size, with zero used if the expected result set size is \
  not known), or a colon-delimited list of two integers and one string \
  (representing the before count, after count, and the primary sort attribute \
  value that should be used as the start of the result set).
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_JOIN_RULE_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value must be one of the following:  the string \
  ''dn:'' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the source entry \
  whose values are the DNs of the entries with which to join; the string \
  ''reverse-dn:'' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the target \
  entry with a value that matches the DN of the source entry; the string \
  ''equals:'' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the source \
  entry, a colon, and the name or OID of an attribute in target entries that \
  must have a value that equals at least one value of the source attribute; \
  or the string ''contains:'' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in \
  the source entry, a colon, and the name or OID of an attribute in target \
  entries that must have a value that matches or contains as a substring at \
  least one value of the source attribute.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_JOIN_BASE_DN_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value may be ''search-base'' to use the base DN \
  from the search request as the base DN for join searches, \
  ''source-entry-dn'' to use the DN of the source entry as the base DN for \
  join searches, or any valid DN to use that DN as the base DN for join \
  searches.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_ROUTE_TO_BACKEND_SET_INVALID_FORMAT=Value ''{0}'' provided for \
  argument ''{1}'' is invalid.  The value must contain the ID of the \
  entry-balancing request processor followed by a colon and the ID of a \
  desired backend set to use for that entry-balancing request processor.

ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MOVE_SUBTREE_MISMATCH=The --moveSubtreeFrom argument must be \
  provided the same number of times as the --moveSubtreeTo argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED_WITH_URLS=The ''{0}'' output \
  format cannot be used in conjunction with the ''{1}'' argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT_REQUIRES_REQUESTED_ATTR_ARG=The ''{0}'' output \
  format requires that the set of requested arguments be identified with the \
  ''{1}'' argument rather than as unnamed trailing arguments.

INFO_LDAPSEARCH_TOTAL_SEARCH_ENTRIES=Total Entries Returned:  {0,number,0}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_TOTAL_SEARCH_REFERENCES=Total References Returned:  \
  {0,number,0}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_1=Establishes an unencrypted LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:389, performs a simple bind to authenticate as user \
  ''uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'', and issues a search request to \
  retrieve the givenName, sn, and mail attributes for the user with uid \
  ''jqpublic'' below dc=example,dc=com.  The search results will be written \
  to standard output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_2=Establishes an SSL-encrypted LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:636, interactively prompting the user about whether \
  to trust the certificate presented by the directory server.  The tool \
  will then bind with the SASL PLAIN mechanism using an authentication ID of \
  ''u:jdoe'' and a password read from a file.  It will then issue a search \
  request for each filter in a given file, writing the results for each \
  search into a separate output file.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_3=Establishes an LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:389 that is secured with the StartTLS extended \
  operation, using the information in the provided trust store file to \
  determine whether to trust the certificate presented by the directory \
  server.  It will then issue an unauthenticated search to retrieve all \
  user and operational attributes from the server''s root DSE.  The output \
  will be written to a specified output file as well as displayed on standard \
  output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_4=Issues a search request to retrieve all entries at \
  or below ''dc=example,dc=com'', using the simple paged results control to \
  retrieve up to 100 entries at a time.  The search will use an unencrypted \
  LDAP connection, and the tool will interactively prompt the user for the \
  password to use when performing simple authentication.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_5=Issues a search request to retrieve a \
  special entry that provides details about the server''s use of indexes to \
  determine the candidate set of potential matching entries.  This feature \
  is only supported in the UnboundID/Ping Identity Directory Server, and \
  the user must have access control rights to retrieve the ''cn=debugsearch'' \
  entry and the ''debugsearchindex'' operational attribute.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=Splits a single LDIF file into multiple \
  sets by separating entries below a specified base DN into different \
  mutually-exclusive collections of entries.  A number of algorithms are \
  available to determine how entries should be split, and entries outside the \
  split base DN may be included in all sets or added to a dedicated LDIF file.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_LDIF=The path to an LDIF file \
  containing the data to be split into multiple sets.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple LDIF files, and the files will \
  be processed in the order they were provided on the command line.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_COMPRESSED=Indicates that the source \
  LDIF files are gzip-compressed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_TARGET_LDIF_BASE=The path and base name to \
  use for the LDIF files containing the data that has been split.  The \
  resulting LDIF files will use this path with different extensions \
  (''.set1'' for the first set, ''.set2'' for the second set, and so on, and \
  ''.outside-split-base-dn'' if a file is to be created to hold entries that \
  exist outside of the split base DN).  If this is not provided, then the \
  source LDIF path will be used as the base name.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_TARGET=Indicates that the target \
  LDIF files should be gzip-compressed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_TARGET=Indicates that the target LDIF \
  files should be encrypted with a key generated from a provided \
  passphrase.  If the --encryptionPassphraseFile argument is provided, then \
  the passphrase will be read from the specified file.  Otherwise, it will be \
  interactively requested from the user.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_PW_FILE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.  This \
  passphrase will be used to decrypt the input (if it is encrypted) and to \
  encrypt the output (if it is to be encrypted).  If this is not provided and \
  either the input or output is encrypted, then the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.  If it is provided, then the specified file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line that is comprised entirely of the \
  encryption passphrase.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SPLIT_BASE_DN=The base DN below which entries \
  should be split.  The entry with this DN will appear in all sets, but each \
  entry below this base DN will appear in exactly one set.  This must be \
  provided.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_OUTSIDE_TO_ALL_SETS=Indicates that entries \
  outside the split base DN should be added to all sets containing split data.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_OUTSIDE_TO_DEDICATED_SET=Indicates that \
  entries outside the split base DN should be added to a dedicated set in its \
  own file.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH=The path to a file or directory \
  from which to read schema definitions to use when processing.  If the \
  provided path is a file, then it must be an LDIF file containing the \
  definitions to read.  If the provided path is a directory, then schema \
  definitions will be read from all files with an extension of ''.ldif'' in \
  that directory.  If this argument is provided multiple times, then the \
  paths will be processed in the order they were provided on the command \
  line.  If this argument is not provided, then a default standard schema \
  will be used.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_NUM_THREADS=The number of threads to use when \
  processing.  If this is not specified, a single thread will be used.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_DESC=Splits the data by computing a hash on \
  the normalized representation of the DN component immediately below the \
  split base DN, and using a modulus operation to determine the set in which \
  to place the entry.  This split algorithm does not require any caching to \
  ensure that a subordinate entry is placed in the same set as its parent.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file ''whole.ldif'' so \
  that entries below ''ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'' will be split into four \
  sets, selected by computing a digest of the RDN component immediately below \
  ''ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'', with names starting with ''split.ldif''.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_DESC=Splits the data by computing a hash on \
  the value(s) of a specified attribute in entries immediately below the \
  split base DN, and using a modulus operation to determine the set in which \
  to place the entry.  If an entry does not contain the target attribute, the \
  set will be chosen based on a hash of the DN component immediately below \
  the split base DN.  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT argument is provided, a \
  cache will be used to ensure that subordinate entries are added into the \
  same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ATTR_NAME=The name or OID of the \
  attribute for which to compute the hash.  This must be provided.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ALL_VALUES=Indicates that the \
  hashing process should examine all values for the target attribute.  If \
  this argument is not provided, then only the first value for the attribute \
  will be used to determine the set in which an entry should be placed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the \
  tool should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly \
  one level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache \
  to determine where a subordinate entry''s parent resides.  If this argument \
  is provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then they will \
  be added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually \
  identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file ''whole.ldif'' so \
  that entries below ''ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'' will be split into four \
  sets, selected by computing a digest of the first value of the ''uid'' \
  attribute, with names starting with ''split.ldif''.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_DESC=Splits the data by selecting the \
  set with the fewest number of entries.  When processing data in a flat DIT, \
  this will essentially be a round-robin distribution.  When processing data \
  in a DIT with branches of varying sizes, this can help ensure that the \
  resulting LDIF files will have roughly the same number of entries (although \
  running the tool with multiple threads may make this less accurate).  \
  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT argument is provided, a cache will be used to \
  ensure that subordinate entries are added into the same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the \
  tool should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly \
  one level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache \
  to determine where a subordinate entry''s parent resides.  If this argument \
  is provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then they will \
  be added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually \
  identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file ''whole.ldif'' \
  into four sets, with names starting with ''split.ldif'', so that each entry \
  immediately below ''ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'' will be placed in the set \
  that currently has the fewest entries.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_DESC=Splits the data by using search filters to \
  select the appropriate set.  The filters will be evaluated in the order \
  they were provided on the command line, and the entry will be added to the \
  first set for which a matching filter is found.  If the entry doesn''t \
  match any of the provided filters, then the appropriate set will be \
  determined by computing a hash on the RDN.  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT \
  argument is provided, a cache will be used to ensure that subordinate \
  entries are added into the same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_ARG_DESC_FILTER=A filter to evaluate against \
  entries exactly one level below the split base DN to determine which set \
  should be used to hold the entry.  This argument should be provided \
  multiple times, once for each set into which the data should be split, and \
  the filters will be evaluated in the order they were provided on the \
  command line until one is found that matches the target entry.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the tool \
  should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly one \
  level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache to \
  determine where a subordinate entry''s parent resides.  If this argument is \
  provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then they will be \
  added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file ''whole.ldif'' into four \
  sets, with names starting with ''split.ldif'', so that each entry \
  immediately below ''ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'' will be selected by \
  matching that entry against a search filter.  Entries matching \
  ''(timeZone=Eastern)'' will go into the first set, entries matching \
  ''(timeZone=Central)'' into the second set, ''(timeZone=Mountain)'' into \
  the third set, and ''(timeZone=Pacific)'' into the fourth.  Any entries not \
  matching any of those filters will be placed by computing a hash on its RDN.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NO_TARGET_BASE_PATH=If the {0} argument is provided multiple \
  times, then the {1} argument must also be provided to specify the base \
  path and name for the file to be written.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NON_UNIQUE_FILTER=All values provided for the ''{0}'' argument \
  must be unique.  Filter ''{1}'' was provided multiple times.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NOT_ENOUGH_FILTERS=If the ''{0}'' subcommand is used, the \

  were given.  This argument must not be used in conjunction with any other \
  argument used to indicate which entries should be deleted.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_DN_FILE=The path to a file containing the DNs of the \
  entries to delete.  Each DN must be on its own line in the file, with blank \
  lines and lines starting with the ''#'' character being ignored.  Each DN \
  line may optionally start with ''dn:'' (or ''dn::'' to indicate that the \
  DN is base64-encoded), and long DNs may be wrapped across multiple lines by \
  starting subsequent lines with at least one space.  This argument may be \

  file containing LDAP search filters (one filter per line, with blank lines \
  and lines starting with the ''#'' character being ignored) that can be used \
  to identify the entries to delete.  The base DN for the searches should be \
  specified using the --searchBaseDN argument, with the null DN being used by \
  default if that argument is not given.  This argument may be provided \
  multiple times to specify the paths to multiple filter files, and the \
  files will be processed in the order they are provided on the command \
  line.  This argument must not be used in conjunction with any other \
  argument used to indicate which entries should be deleted.

  entries to delete.  This argument may only be used in conjunction with the \
  --deleteEntriesMatchingFilter or --deleteEntriesMatchingFiltersFromFile \
  arguments.  It may be provided multiple times to specify multiple search \
  base DNs.  If this argument is not given, the null DN will be used as the \
  base DN for the searches.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_SEARCH_PAGE_SIZE=The page size to use in conjunction \
  with the simple paged results control when retrieving entries.  This \
  argument may be used in conjunction with either the \
  --deleteEntriesMatchingFilter or the --deleteEntriesMatchingFilterFromFile \
  argument to indicate that the search should use the simple paged results \
  control to retrieve the entries in pages rather than all at once.  It may \
  also be used in conjunction with the --clientSideSubtreeDelete argument to \
  indicate the page size for the simple paged results control that it uses.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPTION_PW_FILE=The path to a file containing \
  the passphrase used to encrypt an input file.  If this is not provided and \

  on a newly created connection.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_NEVER_RETRY=Indicates that the tool should not \
  attempt to retry operations that fail in a way that the connection to \
  the directory server may be invalid.  By default, it will automatically \
  try to establish a new connection and retry the failed operation.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_DRY_RUN=Indicates that the tool should display what \
  it would do, and may perform searches if appropriate, but will not actually \
  attempt to delete any entries.  Note that if the server supports the \
  no-operation request control, you may wish to use the --noOperation \
  argument instead, which will actually send the delete requests with a \
  control indicating that the server should perform as much validation of \
  the request that it can, but should not actually delete the target entry.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR=Indicates that the tool should \
  continue processing even after encountering an error.  This is only \
  applicable if it is run with arguments that would cause it to attempt to \

  requests should be processed as server-side subtree deletes by using the \
  subtree delete request control.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_SOFT_DELETE=Indicates that delete requests should \
  include the Ping Identity-proprietary soft delete request control to \
  indicate that the server should hide the entries rather than deleting \
  them immediately.  Soft-deleted may or may not be completely removed after \
  a period of time, based on the server configuration.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_HARD_DELETE=Indicates that delete requests should \
  include the Ping Identity-proprietary hard delete request control to \
  indicate that the target entries should be completely removed, even if they \
  would have otherwise been processed as soft deletes.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_AUTHZ_ID='{'authzID'}'
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_PROXY_AS=Indicates that search and delete requests \

INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_ROUTE_TO_SERVER=Indicates that search and delete \
  requests should include the Ping Identity-proprietary route to server \
  request control to indicate that the Directory Proxy Server should forward \
  those requests to the specified backend server.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_USE_ASSURED_REPLICATION=Indicates that delete \
  requests should include the Ping Identity-proprietary assured replication \
  request control to delay the response from the server until the change has \
  been replicated to other servers.  The --assuredReplicationLocalLevel, \
  --assuredReplicationRemoteLevel, and --assuredReplicationTimeout arguments \
  may also be used to customize the content of the request control.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ASSURED_REPLICATION_LOCAL_LEVEL=\

  assurance level that should be used for servers in a different location \
  from the server that originally processed the change.  The value must be \
  one of ''none'', ''received-any-remote-location'', \
  ''received-all-remote-locations'', or ''processed-all-remote-servers''.  If \
  this is not provided, the server will determine an appropriate remote \
  assurance level.
INFO_LDAPDELETE_ARG_DESC_ASSURED_REPLICATION_TIMEOUT=The maximum length of \
  time that the server should delay the response to the delete operation \
  while waiting for the desired replication assurance to be achieved.  If \
  this is not provided, the server will determine an appropriate timeout to \
  use.

  sensitive data, and the entire archive may be encrypted if you desire, you \
  may wish to review the resulting support data archive to ensure verify its \
  contents.  Further, the archive will include a summary of any potential \
  problems or concerns that are identified in the course of collecting the \
  support data.
INFO_CSD_ARG_GROUP_OUTPUT=Output Arguments
INFO_CSD_ARG_GROUP_COLLECTION=Data Collection Arguments
INFO_CSD_ARG_GROUP_COMMUNICATION=Communication Arguments
INFO_CSD_ARG_DEC_USE_REMOTE_SERVER=Indicates that the collect-support-data \
  request should be sent to a server over LDAP rather than operating against \
  the local instance.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Indicates that the tool should attempt to \
  use an administrative session to process all operations using a dedicated \
  pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying to diagnose \
  problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal worker threads \
  are busy processing other requests.  This argument may only be used in \
  conjunction with the --useRemoteServer argument.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ADDRESS='{'address'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_PROXY_TO_ADDRESS=The address of a server to which the \
  collect-support-data extended request should be forwarded.  This may be \
  useful for retrieving support data information from a backend Directory \
  Server instance that can only be accessed through a Directory Proxy \
  Server.  The server to which the initial request will be sent (the one \
  specified by the --hostname and --port arguments) must either be configured \
  with an LDAP external server that has the specified proxy-to address and \
  port values or there must be a server instance with that address and port \
  in the topology registry.  This argument may only be provided if both the \
  --useRemoteServer and --proxyToServerPort arguments are also given.

INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_PROXY_TO_PORT=The port of a server to which the \
  collect-support-data extended request should be forwarded.  This argument \
  may only be provided if both the --useRemoteServer and \
  --proxyToServerAddress arguments are also given.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_PATH=Specifies the path to which the support data \
  archive should be written.  If this path references a file that already \
  exists, then that file will be overwritten with the new support data \
  archive.  If it references a directory that already exists, then a new \
  support data archive will be created in that directory with a name that is \
  dynamically generated.  If it references a file that does not exist, then \
  the parent directory must exist, and a new support data archive file will \
  be created with that path and name.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_NO_LDAP=Indicates that no attempt should be made to \
  collect any information over LDAP.  This option should only be used as a \
  last resort if the server is completely unresponsive or will not start, and \
  it must not be used in conjunction with the --useRemoteServer argument.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_PID='{'pid'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_PID=Specifies the process ID of an additional process \
  about which information should be collected.  This option may be useful for \
  troubleshooting external server tools.  It may be provided multiple times \
  to specify multiple process IDs.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_SEQUENTIAL=Collect data sequentially rather than in \
  parallel.  This has the effect of reducing the initial memory footprint of \
  this tool, but at the expense of taking longer to complete.  Use this \
  option if running without it results in out-of-memory errors.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_COUNT='{'count'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_REPORT_COUNT=The number of intervals of data to collect \
  from tools that use interval-based sampling (e.g., vmstat, iostat, mpstat, \
  etc.).  A value of zero indicates that no information should be collected \
  from these tools.  If this argument is not provided, then data will be \
  collected from ten intervals by default.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_SECONDS='{'seconds'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_REPORT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=The number of seconds that should \
  elapse between intervals from tools that use interval-based sampling \
  (e.g., vmstat, iostat, mpstat, etc.).  If this argument is provided, the \
  value must be greater than zero.  If it is not provided, an interval \
  duration of one second will be used by default.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_JSTACK_COUNT=The number of times the jstack tool should be \
  invoked to obtain stack traces of all threads running in the JVM.  A value \
  of zero indicates that the jstack tool should not be invoked.  If this \
  argument is not provided, the tool will be invoked ten times by default.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_COLLECT_EXPENSIVE_DATA=Indicates that the tool should \
  attempt to collect information that may be time-consuming or \
  resource-intensive to obtain, or that may affect server performance or \
  responsiveness.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_COLLECT_REPL_STATE=Indicates that the support data archive \
  should include a replication state dump, which may be several megabytes in \
  size.  This argument cannot be used in conjunction with the --noLDAP \
  argument.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_INCLUDE_BINARY_FILES=Indicates that the support data \
  archive should include any binary files that would have otherwise been \
  omitted, but that may contain information that could be helpful in \
  investigating the underlying issue.  Note that sensitive information in \
  these binary files may not be obscured or redacted in the same way that \
  it would be in plain text files.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_SECURITY_LEVEL='{'none|obscure-secrets|maximum'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_SECURITY_LEVEL=Specifies the degree to which the tool \
  will attempt to obscure or omit potentially sensitive information.  A \
  value of ''none'' indicates that the tool will not attempt to obscure or \
  redact any information.  A value of ''obscure-secrets'' indicates that the \
  tool will attempt to obscure secret information (like the values of \
  sensitive configuration properties) and omit log files containing user \
  data (like the data recovery log).  A value of ''maximum'' indicates that \
  the tool will take even more drastic measures, like omitting access log \
  files and obscuring attribute values in entry DNs and search filters, but \
  at the risk of omitting information that could be useful in investigating \
  the associated issue.  If this is not provided, a value of \
  ''obscure-secrets'' will be used by default.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT=Indicates that the resulting support data archive \
  should be encrypted.  If the --passphraseFile argument is provided in \
  conjunction with the --generatePassphrase argument, then a passphrase will \
  dynamically generated and written to the specified file.  If the \
  --passphraseFile argument is provided without the --generatePassphrase \
  argument, then that file must exist and it will be read to obtain the \
  passphrase used to generate the encryption key.  If the --passphraseFile \
  argument is not provided, then the encryption passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.  Note that when providing an encrypted \
  collect-support-data archive to support personnel, it is strongly \
  recommended that the passphrase be provided over a separate channel than \
  the encrypted archive itself to help prevent unauthorized third-party access.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_PASSPHRASE_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  passphrase used to encrypt or decrypt the support data archive.  If this \
  file exists, then it must contain exactly one line that consists entirely \
  of the encryption passphrase.  If this file does not exist, then the \
  --generatePassphrase argument must have also been provided, and the \
  generated passphrase will be written into the specified file.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_GENERATE_PASSPHRASE=Indicates that the tool should \
  automatically generate the passphrase used to generate the encryption key \
  and write it to the file specified by the --passphraseFile argument.  This \
  argument may only be used if both the --encrypt and --passphraseFile \
  arguments are also provided.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_DECRYPT=Decrypts the encrypted support data archive \
  contained in the specified file.  If the --passphraseFile argument is \
  provided, then it will be used to obtain the passphrase to use to generate \
  the encryption key.  Otherwise, the passphrase will be interactively \
  requested.
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_TIME_RANGE='{'startTime[,endTime]'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_TIME_RANGE=Include log messages falling within the \
  indicated time range.  The start and end time values should be formatted in \
  the generalized time format (e.g., ''YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuuZ''), a format \
  similar to the generalized time format but without the time zone indicator \
  to indicate that the value should be in the local time zone (e.g., \
  ''YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuu''), or the server''s default log timestamp format \
  (e.g., ''[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss Z]'' or ''[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss.uuu Z]'').  \
  If the end time is omitted, the current time will be used.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_DURATION=Include log messages within the specified \
  duration before the current time.  If specified, the value must consist of \
  an integer followed by a time unit, which may be one of millisecond, \
  second, minute, hour, or day, or their plurals (e.g., ''5 minutes'' or \
  ''1 hour'').
INFO_CSD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_SIZE_KB='{'sizeKB'}'
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_LOG_HEAD_SIZE_KB=The amount of data in kilobytes that the \
  tool should capture from the beginning of each log file.  If this is \
  specified, then the value must be greater than or equal to zero.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_LOG_TAIL_SIZE_KB=The amount of data in kilobytes that the \
  tool should capture from the end of each log file.  If this is specified, \
  then the value must be greater than or equal to zero.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_ARCHIVE_EXTENSION_SOURCE=Indicates that the resulting \
  support data archive should include the source code (if available) for \
  any third-party extensions installed in the server.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_COMMENT=Provides a comment that will be included in a \
  README file within the support data archive.  This comment may provide \
  additional context about the issue being investigated.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_NO_PROMPT=Indicates that the tool should not interactively \
  prompt for any information, but should fail if any required information is \
  not provided.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_DRY_RUN=Indicates that the tool should validate the \
  set of arguments but should not actually generate the support data \
  archive.  If the --useRemoteServer argument is provided, then the extended \
  request will include the LDAP no-operation request control.
INFO_CSD_ARG_DESC_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the tool should generate \
  script-friendly output.
ERR_CSD_PASSPHRASE_FILE_MISSING=Passphrase file ''{0}'' does not exist.
ERR_CSD_TIME_RANGE_START_GREATER_THAN_END=The value provided for the \
  ''--logTimeRange'' argument is not valid because the start time is after \
  the end time.
ERR_CSD_TIME_RANGE_CANNOT_PARSE_TIMESTAMP=The value provided for the \
  --logTimeRange argument is not valid because value ''{0}'' cannot be parsed \
  as a timestamp in any of the supported formats.  Supported formats include \
  the generalized time format (e.g., ''YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuuZ''), a format \
  similar to the generalized time format but without the time zone indicator \
  to indicate that the value should be in the local time zone (e.g., \
  ''YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuu''), or the server''s default log timestamp format \
  (e.g., ''[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss Z]'' or ''[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss.uuu Z]'').

INFO_PWMOD_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_1=Update the password for a user in an LDAP \
  directory server using the password modify extended operation (as defined \
  in RFC 3062), a standard LDAP modify operation, or an Active \
  Directory-specific modification.
INFO_PWMOD_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=Unless the password change method is explicitly \
  specified (using the --passwordChangeMethod argument), this tool will \
  attempt to automatically determine which method is the most appropriate for \
  the target server using information provided in the server''s root DSE.  \
  If the server advertises support for the password modify extended \
  operation, then that method will be used.  If it appears to be an Active \
  Directory server, then an Active Directory-specific password change method \
  will be selected, using a regular LDAP modify to update the unicodePwd \
  attribute with a specially encoded value.  Otherwise, a regular LDAP \
  modify operation will be used to update the value of a specified \
  password attribute.
INFO_PWMOD_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=The new password to set for the user may be \
  specified in one of several ways.  It may be directly provided on the \
  command line, read from a specified file, interactively prompted from the \
  user, or automatically generated by this tool.  If the new password is not \
  specified using any of those methods, and if the password is to be updated \
  using the password modify extended operation, then the new password field \
  of the request will be left blank to indicate that the server should \
  generate a new password for the user and include it in the response to the \
  client.  If no new password is specified and some other password change \
  method is selected, then the tool will exit with an error.
INFO_PWMOD_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4=The current password for the user may also be \
  specified.  This is optional, although some servers may require a user to \
  provide their current password when setting a new one.  If a current \
  password is provided (whether given as a command-line argument, read from a \
  specified file, or interactively requested from the user), and if a \
  regular LDAP modify operation is used to change the password, then the \
  resulting modify request will include a delete of the current value and an \
  add of the new value.  If no current password is provided, then the modify \
  request will replace any existing password(s) with the new value.

INFO_PWMOD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_DN_OR_AUTHZID='{'dnOrAuthzID'}'
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_USER_IDENTITY=The identity for the user whose password \
  should be changed.  This may be a DN, or it may be an authorization \
  identity in either the form ''dn:'' followed by a user DN or ''u:'' \
  followed by a username.  If neither this argument nor the \
  --provideBindDNAsUserIdentity argument is provided, then the current \
  authorization identity for the underlying connection will be assumed.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_PROVIDE_BIND_DN_AS_USER_IDENTITY=Explicitly provide the \
  bind DN as the value of the user identity field in the password modify \
  extended request, rather than omitting that field.  This argument only \
  applies when changing passwords using the password modify extended \
  operation, although the bind DN may be used as the target entry DN for \
  modify requests if no alternate user identity is specified.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ATTRIBUTE_NAME='{'attributeName'}'
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE=The name of the attribute that will be \
  used to search for the user to update if the user identity is provided as a \
  username rather than a DN, and if the password is to be updated with an \
  LDAP modify operation rather than the password modify extended operation.  \
  This argument will be ignored if the authorization identity is provided as a \
  DN or if password will be changed using the password modify extended \
  operation.  If this is not provided, then a default value of ''uid'' will \
  be used for non-Active Directory servers, and default values of \
  ''samAccountName'' and ''userPrincipalName'' will be used for Active \
  Directory.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple user ID attributes, in which case the search will construct an OR \
  filter to search across each of those attributes.  The resulting search \
  must match exactly one entry for the password change attempt to proceed.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_SEARCH_BASE_DN=The base DN to use when searching for the \
  user to update.  This will be ignored if the user identity is provided as \
  a DN or if the password will be changed using the password modify extended \

INFO_PWMOD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_CHARS='{'chars'}'
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_GENERATED_PASSWORD_CHARACTER_SET=A set of characters that \
  may be included in the generated client-side password.  This may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple character sets, in which case \
  the generated password will include at least one character from each of \
  the sets.  If this is not provided, then the generated password will be a \
  mix of lowercase ASCII letters, uppercase ASCII letters, ASCII digits, and \
  a selected set of ASCII symbols.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_CURRENT_PASSWORD=The current password to provide when \
  setting the new password.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_CURRENT_PASSWORD_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  current password to provide when setting the new password.  If this is \
  provided, then the file must exist and it must contain exactly one line \

  policy request control (as described in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy) \
  in the bind request used to authenticate to the server.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTRIBUTE=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get authorization entry request control in the bind \
  request to indicate that the bind response should include the entry for \
  the authenticated user with the specified attribute.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify that multiple attributes from the \
  user entry should be included.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_GET_USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get user resource limits request control in the bind \
  request to indicate that the server should return information about \
  resource limits (e.g., size limit, time limit, idle time limit, etc.) \
  imposed for the user.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_UPDATE_CONTROL=Include the specified control in the \
  request used to update the user''s password.  This may be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple update controls.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_USE_PW_POLICY_CONTROL_ON_UPDATE=Include the password \
  policy request control (as described in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy) \
  in the request used to update the user''s password.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_NO_OPERATION=Include the LDAP no-operation request \
  control (as described in draft-zeilenga-ldap-noop) to indicate that the \
  server should validate that the password change would likely succeed, but \
  that the user''s password should not actually be changed.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_VALUE='{'name=value'}'
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_PASSWORD_UPDATE_BEHAVIOR=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary password update behavior request control in the \
  request used to update the password to specify settings that the server \
  should use when updating the password.  Values of this argument must be in \
  the form ''name=value'', where the property name can be any one of the \
  following:  is-self-change, allow-pre-encoded-password, \
  skip-password-validation, ignore-password-history, \
  ignore-minimum-password-age, password-storage-scheme, and \
  must-change-password.  The value for each property should be either \
  ''true'' or ''false'', with the exception of the storage-scheme property, \
  whose value should be the name of the desired password storage scheme to \
  use to encode the new password.  This argument can be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple password update behaviors.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_GET_PW_VALIDATION_DETAILS=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get password validation details request control in \
  the request used to update the password.  The corresponding response \
  control will include information about the requirements that the server \
  will impose for the target user and whether the provided new password \
  satisfies each of those constraints.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_RETIRE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Include the UnboundID-proprietary \
  retire password request control in the request used to update the \
  password.  This will indicate that the server should continue to allow the \
  user to authenticate with their former password (in addition to the \
  new password) for a brief period of time.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_PURGE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Indicate the UnboundID-proprietary \
  purge password request control in the request used to update the password.  \
  This will indicate that the server should completely remove the former \
  password from the user''s entry, even if the server would have otherwise \
  retired the former password for a brief period of time.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_ASSURED_REPLICATION=Include the UnboundID-proprietary \

  should be delayed until the change has been sufficiently replicated to \
  other servers.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_LEVEL='{'level'}'
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_ASSURED_REPLICATION_LOCAL_LEVEL=The local assurance level \
  to use in the assured replication request control.  If provided, the value \
  should be one of ''none'' (to indicate that the update response should not \
  be delayed for replication to local servers), ''received-any-server'' (to \
  indicate that the update response should be delayed until the change has \
  been received by, but not necessarily applied on, at least one other local \
  server), or ''processed-all-servers'' (to indicate that the update response \
  should be delayed until the change has been applied in all available local \
  servers).  If this is not specified, then the server will select an \
  appropriate local assurance level.
INFO_PWMOD_ARG_DESC_ASSURED_REPLICATION_REMOTE_LEVEL=The remote assurance \
  level to use in the assured replication request control.  The value should \
  be one of ''none'' (to indicate that the update response should not be \
  delayed for replication to remote servers), \

  should be delayed until the change has been received by, but not \
  necessarily applied on, at least one server in at least one remote \
  location), ''received-all-remote-locations'' (to indicate that the update \
  response should be delayed until the change has been received by, but not \
  necessarily applied on, at least one server in every remote location ), or \
  ''processed-all-remote-servers'' (to indicate that the update response \
  should be delayed until the change has been applied by all available remote \
  servers in all locations).  If this is not specified, then the server will \

  user identity, either as a valid, non-empty DN (optionally preceded by \
  ''dn:'') or a non-empty username (which must be preceded by ''u:'').
ERR_PWMOD_USER_IDENTITY_EMPTY_DN=ERROR:  The DN of the target user for the \
  password update was determined to be the null DN (that is, the DN of the \
  root DSE entry).  This suggests that either an empty user identity was \
  explicitly specified, that the empty user identity was inferred because \
  no authentication credentials were provided, or that anonymous \
  authentication was performed.  Use the ''{0}'' argument to specify the \
  user identity, either as a valid, non-empty DN (optionally preceded by \
  ''dn:'') or a non-empty username (which must be preceded by ''u:'').
INFO_PWMOD_USER_IDENTITY_DN_FOR_MOD=Using DN ''{0}'' as the user identity for \

INFO_PWMOD_EXAMPLE_1=Perform a self password change as the user with a \
  username of ''jdoe'', with both the current and new passwords obtained from \
  interactive prompting.  The tool will automatically determine the best \
  method to use to change the password.
INFO_PWMOD_EXAMPLE_2=Use a regular LDAP modify operation to perform an \
  administrative reset of the password for user \
  ''uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com''.  The tool will generate a new \
  password for the user.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_1=Perform compare operations in an LDAP \
  directory server.  Compare operations may be used to efficiently determine \
  whether a specified entry has a given value.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=The exit code for this tool will indicate \
  whether processing was successful or unsuccessful, and to provide a basic \
  indication of the reason for unsuccessful attempts.  By default, it will \
  use an exit code of zero (which corresponds to the LDAP ''success'' result) \
  if all compare operations completed with a result code of either ''compare \
  false'' or ''compare true'' (integer values 5 and 6, respectively), but if \
  the --useCompareResultCodeAsExitCode argument is provided, only one \
  compare assertion is performed, and it yields an exit code of ''compare \
  false'' or ''compare true'', then the numeric value for that result code \
  will be used as the exit code.  If any error occurs during processing, then \
  the exit code will be a nonzero value that reflects the first error result \
  that was encountered.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=The attribute type and assertion value \
  to use for the compare operations will typically be provided as the first \
  unnamed trailing argument provided on the command line.  It should be \
  formatted with the name or OID of the target attribute type followed by a \
  single colon and the string representation of the assertion value.  \
  Alternatively, the attribute name or OID may be followed by two colons and \
  the base64-encoded representation of the assertion value, or it may be \
  followed by a colon and a less-than symbol to indicate that the assertion \
  value should be read from a file (in which case the exact bytes of the \
  file, including line breaks, will be used as the assertion value).
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4=The DNs of the entries to compare may \
  either be provided on the command line as additional unnamed trailing \
  arguments after the provided attribute-value assertion, or they may be \
  read from a file whose path is provided using the --dnFile argument.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_5=If the attribute-value assertion is \
  provided on the command line as an unnamed trailing argument, then the same \
  assertion will be performed for all operations.  If multiple types of \
  assertions should be performed, then you may use the --assertionFile \
  argument to specify the path to a file containing both attribute-value \
  assertions and entry DNs.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_TRAILING_ARGS_PLACEHOLDER=\
  [attribute:value|attribute::base64Value|attribute:<valueFilePath [dn1 [dn2 \
  [ dn3 [ .. ]]]]]
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_GROUP_PROCESSING=Processing Arguments
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_GROUP_BIND_CONTROLS=Bind Control Arguments
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_GROUP_COMPARE_CONTROLS=Compare Control Arguments
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_GROUP_OUTPUT=Output Arguments
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DN_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  DNs of the entries in which to perform the compare assertions.  If this \
  argument is provided, then each DN must be provided on its own line with \
  no other content on that line, and there must be exactly one unnamed \
  trailing argument to specify the attribute-value assertion to evaluate \
  against all entries referenced in the DN file.  If this argument is not \
  provided, then there must be at least two unnamed trailing arguments, with \
  the first specifying the attribute-value assertion and all remaining \
  trailing arguments providing the DNs of the entries to evaluate.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSERTION_FILE=The path to a file with \
  information about the compare assertions to be evaluated.  If this is \
  provided, then each line of the file must contain the DN of the target \
  entry followed by one or more horizontal tab characters and the \
  attribute-value assertion to process against that entry (specified as the \
  attribute name followed by a single colon and the string representation of \
  the assertion value, the attribute name followed by two colons and a \
  base64-encoded representation of the assertion value, or the attribute name \
  followed by a colon, a less-than sign, and the path to a file from which \
  the raw assertion value should be read).
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FOLLOW_REFERRALS=Attempt to follow any \
  referrals encountered during compare processing.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Use an administrative \
  session to process all operations using a dedicated pool of worker \
  threads.  This may be useful when trying to diagnose problems in a server \
  that is unresponsive because all normal worker threads are busy processing \
  other requests.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR=Continue processing even \
  if there are errors.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DRY_RUN=Indicate which compare assertions \
  would be processed, but do not actually send them to the server.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_BIND_CONTROL=Include the indicated control \
  in all bind requests used to authenticate to the server.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_AUTHZ_IDENTITY=Include the authorization \
  identity request control (as described in RFC 3829) in all bind requests.  \
  If this control is included, a successful bind result should include the \
  authorization identity assigned to the connection.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_PW_POLICY_CONTROL=Include the password \
  policy request control (as described in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy) \
  in all bind requests.  If this control is included, the bind result may \
  include additional information about the target user''s password policy \
  state.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ATTRIBUTE='{'attribute'}'
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTR=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get authorization entry request control in all bind \
  requests to indicate that the bind result should include the specified \
  attributes from the entries for the authentication and authorization \
  identities.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple attributes to request.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_GET_USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary get user resource limits request control in all \
  bind requests to indicate that a successful bind result should include \
  information about resource limits (e.g., size limit, time limit, idle \
  time limit, etc.) that the server may impose for the user.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_COMPARE_CONTROL=Include the indicated \
  control in all compare requests sent to the directory server.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_AUTHZ_ID='{'authzID'}'
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_AS=Include the proxied authorization \
  control (also known as the proxied authorization v2 request control, as \
  described in RFC 4370) in compare requests to indicate that the server \
  should process the operation under the authority of the specified user.  \
  The authorization identity should generally be specified in the form \
  ''dn:'' followed by the DN of the target user, or ''u:'' followed by a \
  username for the target user.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_V1_AS=Include the proxied \
  authorization v1 request control (as described in \
  draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-04) in compare requests to indicate that the \
  server should process the operation under the authority of the user with \
  the specified DN.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Include the manageDsaIT \
  request control in all compare requests to indicate that any referral \
  entries should be treated as regular entries rather than causing the \
  server to generate a referral result.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSERTION_FILTER=Include the LDAP assertion \
  request control (as described in RFC 4528) in all compare requests to \
  indicate that the compare operation should only be evaluated if the target \
  entry matches the provided filter.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_PURPOSE='{'purpose'}'
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OPERATION_PURPOSE=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary operation purpose request control in all compare \
  requests to provide information about the purpose for the operation.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FILE=The path to a file to which \
  standard output should be written.  Messages written to standard error \
  will not be written to this file.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TEE_OUTPUT=Write standard output messages to \
  both the specified output file and the default standard output stream.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_FORMAT='{'tab-delimited|csv|json'}'
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FORMAT=Specifies the format in which \
  the output should be written.  Allowed values include ''tab-delimited'' \
  ''csv'', or ''json''.  For each output format, the output will include the \
  DN of the target entry, the name of the attribute type, the assertion \
  value, the numeric value for the result code, and the name for the result \
  code.  The JSON format may also include additional fields.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the output \
  should be generated in a script-friendly format.  This argument is not \
  used, as the output will always be in a script-friendly format, and the \
  --outputFormat argument may be used to customize the format in which the \
  output is written.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_VERBOSE=Indicates that the tool should \
  generate verbose output.  If this is provided, then complete details about \
  the result of each compare operation will be written to standard error.  If \
  this is not provided, then that detail will only be written for operations \
  that include an error result or that include one or more response controls.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TERSE=Indicates that the tool should \
  generate terse output.  If this is provided, then additional compare \
  output will be suppressed, even for error results and results with \
  response controls.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_ARG_DESC_USE_COMPARE_RESULT_CODE_AS_EXIT_CODE=Use the \
  integer value of the compare operation result code as the tool exit code.  \
  This primarily applies to cases in which only a single compare assertion \
  is processed and the response to that compare operation has a result code \
  of either ''compare false'' (integer value 5) or ''compare true'' (integer \
  value 6).  By default, the tool will use an exit code of zero in such cases \
  to indicate that processing completed successfully, but the exit code may \
  be useful in scripts to more easily obtain the result of the compare \
  operation.  Note that if multiple compare operations are all processed \
  successfully, then the tool will always return an exit code of zero, and if \
  an error is encountered during processing, then the exit code will reflect \
  the LDAP result code for that associated error.  This option only affects \
  the tool exit code and does not alter the visible output in any way.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_CANNOT_OPEN_OUTPUT_FILE=An error occurred while attempting to \
  open output file ''{0}'' for writing:  {1}
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_ALL_SUCCEEDED=All compare operations completed \
  without error.  True results:  {0,number,0}.  False results:  {1,number,0}.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_COMPARE_MATCHED=The attribute-value assertion matched \
  the target entry.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_COMPARE_DID_NOT_MATCH=The attribute-value assertion \
  did not match the target entry.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_WITH_ERRORS=Processing completed with one or more \
  errors.  True results:  {0,number,0}.  False results:  {1,number,0}.  \
  Error results:  {2,number,0}.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_FAILED=The compare operation failed.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_TRAILING_ARGS_WITH_ASSERTION_FILE=If the {0} argument is \
  provided, then there must not be any unnamed trailing arguments.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_INVALID_TRAILING_ARG_COUNT_WITH_DN_FILE=If the {0} argument \
  is provided, then there must be exactly one unnamed trailing argument, \
  which should specify the attribute-value assertion to use for all compare \
  requests.  The attribute-value assertion should be formatted with the name \
  or OID of the target attribute type followed by either a single colon and \
  the string representation of the assertion value, two colons and the \
  base64-encoded representation of the assertion value, or a colon and a \
  less-than sign followed by the path to a file from which the raw assertion \
  value will be read.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_INVALID_TRAILING_ARG_COUNT_WITHOUT_FILE=If neither the {0} \
  nor the {0} argument is provided, then there must be at least two unnamed \
  trailing arguments.  The first trailing argument should specify the \
  attribute-value assertion to use for all compare requests, which should be \
  formatted with the name or OID of the target attribute type followed by \
  either a single colon and the string representation of the assertion value, \
  two colons and the base64-encoded representation of the assertion value, or \
  a colon and a less-than sign followed by the path to the file from which \
  the raw assertion value should be read.  All remaining trailing arguments \
  should specify the DNs of the entries in which to process the compare \
  requests.

  should be read from file ''{1}'', but that file does not exist.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_ASSERTION_FILE_EMPTY=Assertion file ''{0}'' does not \
  contain any compare assertions.
ERR_LDAPCOMPARE_ASSERTION_FILE_LINE_MISSING_TAB=Unable to parse line ''{0}'' \
  (line number {1,number,0}) read from file ''{2}'' to create a compare \

INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_EXAMPLE_1=Use an LDAP compare operation to determine whether \
  entry ''uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'' has a value of ''Austin'' \
  for the ''l'' attribute.  The result of the compare operation will be \
  displayed in the default tab-delimited text format.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_EXAMPLE_2=Use a series of LDAP compare operations to \
  determine which of the entries with DNs are read from the file \
  ''entry-dns.txt'' have a ''title'' value of ''manager''.  The result of \
  each compare operation will be displayed in the comma-separated values \
  (CSV) format, with all unnecessary output suppressed.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_EXAMPLE_3=Use a series of LDAP compare operations using \
  both entry DNs and attribute-value assertions read from the file \
  ''compare-assertions.txt''.  The results of the compare operations will be \
  written in JSON format to the file ''compare-assertion-results.json'', and \
  verbose output about the processing will be written to standard error.
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_HEADER=Compare Result:
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_HEADER_DN=Entry DN: {0}
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_HEADER_ATTR=Attribute Name: {0}
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_RESULT_HEADER_VALUE=Assertion Value: {0}
INFO_LDAPCOMPARE_FORMAT_HEADER_DN=Entry DN

INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_1=Use multiple concurrent threads to \
  apply a set of add, delete, modify, and modify DN operations read from an \
  LDIF file.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=As with other tools like ldapmodify, \
  changes in the LDIF file to be processed should be ordered such that if \
  there are any dependencies between changes (for example, if one add change \
  record creates a parent entry and another add change record creates a child \
  of that parent), prerequisite changes come before the changes that depend \
  on them.  When this tool is preparing to process a change, it will \
  determine whether the new change depends on any other changes that are \
  currently in progress, and if so, will delay processing that change until \
  its dependencies have been satisfied.  If a change does not depend on any \
  other changes that are currently being processed, then it can be processed \
  in parallel with those changes.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=This tool will keep track of any \
  changes that fail in a way that indicates they succeed if re-tried later \
  (for example, an attempt to add an entry that fails because its parent does \
  not exist, but its parent may be created later in the set of LDIF changes), \
  and can optionally re-try those changes after processing is complete.  Any \
  changes that are not retried, as well as changes that still fail after the \
  retry attempts, will be written to a rejects file with information about \
  the reason for the failure so that an administrator can take any necessary \
  further action upon them.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_GROUP_PROCESSING=Change Processing Arguments
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_LDIF_FILE=The path to the LDIF file containing \
  the changes to process.  This must be specified, and the file must exist.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_IS_COMPRESSED=Indicates that the LDIF file is \
  gzip-compressed.  This argument is no longer required, as the tool will \
  automatically detect whether the LDIF file is compressed or encrypted.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE_FILE=The path to a file \
  containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the LDIF file.  \
  If this argument is not provided and the LDIF file is encrypted, then the \
  tool may interactively prompt for the encryption passphrase.  If this \
  argument is provided, then the file must exist and it must contain exactly \
  one line that is comprised only of the encryption passphrase.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_LOG_FILE=The path to a log file that will be \
  written with a record of all operations attempted during processing.  If \
  this is specified, then the file does not need to exist, but the parent \
  directory must exist.  If this is not specified, then no log file will be \
  kept.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_REJECT_FILE=The path to a file that will be \
  written with a record of all operations that could not be completed \
  successfully, even after all retry attempts.  This must be specified, and \
  the file does not need to exist, but the parent directory must exist.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_USE_FIRST_REJECT_RC=Indicates that the tool should use \
  the result code for the first rejected operation (if any) as the exit \
  code.  By default, the tool will use an exit code of zero if all changes \
  were attempted, even if some of those changes were rejected.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_NEVER_RETRY=Indicates that the tool should \
  never attempt to retry any failed operations.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_DEFAULT_ADD=Indicates that any LDIF records \
  without a changetype should be treated as add requests.  If this is not \
  provided, then LDIF records without a changetype will be rejected.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_FOLLOW_REFERRALS=Indicates that the tool should \
  attempt to follow any referrals that the server returns.  If this is not \
  provided, then referral results will be treated as failures.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_NUM_THREADS=The number of threads to use when \
  processing operations in parallel.  The value must be greater than or equal \
  to one, with a value of one indicating that processing should be performed \
  in a single thread (without any parallelism).  If this is not specified, \
  a default of eight threads will be used.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_RATE_PER_SECOND=The maximum rate (in number \
  of requests per second) at which the tool should attempt to process \
  requests.  If this is specified, the value must be greater than or equal to \
  one.  If this is not specified, then no rate limiting will be performed.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_GROUP_CONTROLS=Request Control Arguments
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_USE_PERMISSIVE_MODIFY=Include the permissive \
  modify request control in all modify requests.  This control indicates that \
  the server should not reject attempts to add attribute values that already \
  exist in the entry or attempts to remove attribute values that do not exist \
  in the entry.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_IGNORE_NO_USER_MOD=Include the proprietary \
  ignore NO-USER-MODIFICATION request control in all add and modify \
  requests.  This control indicates that the server should not reject \
  requests in which the client attempts to set values for attribute types \
  declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION constraint in the schema.  This \
  control primarily applies to add operations, but the server can be \
  configured to allow it for a limited set of attributes in modify operation.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_PROXY_AS='{'authzID'}'
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_PROXY_AS=Include the proxied authorization \
  request control (as described in RFC 4370, also known as the proxied \
  authorization v2 request control) in all add, delete, modify, and modify DN \
  requests.  This control indicates that the operation should be processed \
  under the authority of an alternate authorization identity.  That \
  authorization identity should generally be specified as either the string \
  ''dn:'' followed by the DN of the entry for the target user or ''u:'' \
  followed by the username for the target user.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_PROXY_V1_AS=Include the proxied authorization \
  v1 request control (as described in draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-04) in all \
  add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests.  This control indicates that \
  the operation should be processed under the authority of an alternate \
  authorization identity, specified as the DN of the entry for the target user.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_PW_UPDATE_BEHAVIOR='{'name=value'}'
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_PW_UPDATE_BEHAVIOR=Include the proprietary \
  password update behavior request control in all add and modify requests.  \
  This control may be used to customize the server''s treatment of any \
  passwords contained in the request.  Values for this argument must be \
  provided in the form ''name=value'', where the property can be any of the \
  following:  is-self-change, allow-pre-encoded-password, \
  skip-password-validation, ignore-password-history, \
  ignore-minimum-password-age, password-storage-scheme, and \
  must-change-password.  The value for the password-storage-scheme property \
  should be the name of the desired scheme, and the value for all other \
  properties should be either ''true'' or ''false''.  This argument can be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple password update behaviors.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_OPERATION_PURPOSE='{'purpose'}'
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_OPERATION_PURPOSE=Include the proprietary \
  operation purpose request control in all requests.  This control provides \
  a human-readable reason for the associated operation.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_USE_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Include the manageDsaIT \
  request control in all add, delete, modify, and modify DN request.  This \
  control indicates that the server should treat referral entries as regular \
  entries, and that the server should attempt to process that change directly \
  against the referral entry rather generating a referral to indicate that \
  the change should be sent to another server or to a different location \
  in the same server.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_NAME_WITH_ENTRYUUID=Include the proprietary \
  name with entryUUID request control in all add requests.  This control \
  indicates that the server should use entryUUID as the naming attribute for \
  the entry, rather than the RDN included in the add request.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_SOFT_DELETE=Include the proprietary soft delete \
  request control in all delete requests.  This control indicates that the \
  server should hide the target entry for a period of time before actually \
  removing it so that it may be restored with an undelete operation if the \
  delete should be reverted.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_HARD_DELETE=Include the proprietary hard delete \
  request control in all delete requests.  This control indicates that the \
  server should completely remove the target entry, even if it would have \
  otherwise automatically processed the operation as a soft delete.
INFO_PARALLEL_UPDATE_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_UNDELETE=Include the proprietary undelete \
  request control in all add requests that include the \
  ''ds-undelete-from-dn'' attribute.  This control indicates that the server \
  should un-delete the target soft-deleted entry rather than creating a \
  new entry.  The server must be configured to allow soft delete operations, \
