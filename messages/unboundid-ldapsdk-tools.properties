INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_TOOL_DESC=Retrieve or update information about the current \
  state of a user account.  Processing will be performed using the password \
  policy state extended operation, and you must have the password-reset \
  privilege to use this extended operation.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_GROUP_TARGET_USER_ARGS=Arguments for Identifying Target \
  Users
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_GROUP_PERFORMANCE=Arguments for Adjusting Performance
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_DN=The DN of the user entry on which to \
  operate.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple \
  user DNs.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_DN_FILE=The path to a file containing the DNs of \
  the user entries on which to operate.  The DN file must contain one DN per \
  line, and blank lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be \
  ignored.  This argument may be provided multiple times to use multiple DN \
  files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_FILTER=An LDAP filter that may be used to \
  identify the user entries on which to operate.  The {0} argument may be \
  used to specify the base DN for the search.  This argument may be provided \
  multiple times to specify multiple target filters.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_FILTER_INPUT_FILE=The path to a file containing a \
  set of LDAP filters to use to identify the user entries on which to \
  operate.  The {0} argument may be used to specify the base DN for the \
  searches.  The filter file must contain one filter per line, and blank \
  lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be ignored.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to use multiple filter files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_TARGET_USER_ID=A string that identifies a user on \
  which to operate.  The tool will search for the user with a base DN \
  specified by the {0} argument and a user ID attribute specified by the {1} \
  argument.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple \
  target user IDs.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_USER_ID_INPUT_FILE=The path to a file containing a \
  set of user ID values.  The file must contain one user ID per line, and \
  blank lines and lines starting with an octothorpe (#) will be ignored.  The \
  tool will search for the users with a base DN specified by the {0} argument \
  and a user ID attribute specified by the {1} argument.  This argument may \
  be provided multiple times to use multiple user ID files.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_USER_ID_ATTR=The name or OID of the attribute used \
  to identify users with IDs specified using the {0} and {1} arguments.  If \
  this argument is not provided, a default user ID attribute of {2} will be \
  used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_BASE_DN=The base DN to use when searching for user \
  entries when using any of the {0}, {1}, {2}, or {3} arguments.  If this \
  argument is not provided, the default base DN will be the null DN.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_SIMPLE_PAGE_SIZE=Indicates that any searches \
  performed to identify which users to target should make use of the simple \
  paged results control to cause the entries to be returned in sets of no \
  more than the specified number of entries.  When processing searches that \
  may return a large number of entries, setting a page size can help reduce \
  the likelihood that the server will need to block while sending results \
  to the client if matching entries are identified much more quickly than \
  the client can process the desired {0} operations against those entries.  \
  Further, when performing searches that may return a large number of \
  entries, and especially for unindexed searches, setting a page size can \
  help the client more efficiently resume processing in the event that the \
  connection used to process the search becomes unusable.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_NUM_THREADS=The number of concurrent threads to use \
  when performing {0} operations against user entries.  If this argument is \
  not provided, a default value of one will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_NUM_SEARCH_THREADS=The number of concurrent threads \
  to use when searching for entries to target with {0} operations.  This will \
  only be used if arguments are provided that require the tool to perform \
  searches to identify which entries to target (and will primarily be useful \
  only in cases in which there will be multiple searches, as when reading \
  filters or user IDs from a file).  If this argument is not provided, a \
  default value of one will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_RATE_PER_SECOND=The maximum rate, in operations per \
  second, at which to target user entries.  If neither this nor the {0} \
  argument is provided, then the tool will not perform any rate limiting.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_VARIABLE_RATE_DATA=The path to a file containing a \
  variable rate definition that may be used to cause the tool to vary the \
  amount of load it generates over time.  If neither this nor the {0} \
  argument is provided, then the tool will not perform any rate limiting.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_GENERATE_SAMPLE_RATE_FILE=The path to a file to \
  create with a sample variable rate definition.  This file will contain \
  comments that describe the expected format for the file to use with the {0} \
  argument.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_REJECT_FILE=The path to a file to write with a \
  record of any unsuccessful attempts to retrieve or update account \
  information for a user.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_APPEND_TO_REJECT_FILE=Indicates that the tool \
  should append to the file specified by the {0} argument if it already \
  exists.  If this argument is not provided and the reject file already \
  exists, it will be overwritten.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_ARG_DESC_SUPPRESS_EMPTY_RESULT_OPERATIONS=Indicates that the \
  result information for each {0} operation processed should suppress \
  information about password policy state operations included in the result \
  that do not have any values.  Operations presented without values generally \
  indicated that the user's password policy is not configured for the \
  associated functionality (e.g., if the password expiration time was \
  requested but password expiration is not enabled in the user's password \
  policy).
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_ALL=Retrieve all available state information for \
  a user.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_GET_ALL_EXAMPLE=Retrieve all available state information \

  be permitted to authenticate or be used as an alternate authorization \
  identity.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_USABILITY_NOTICES=Retrieve any password policy \
  state account usability notice messages for a user.  These messages may \
  provide useful information about the state of the user account, but do not \
  necessarily represent a current or imminent problem with the account.

  policy state account usability warning messages for user ''{0}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_GET_USABILITY_ERRORS=Retrieve any password policy \
  state account usability error messages for a user.  The messages may \
  provide information about conditions that prevent a user account from \
  authenticating, being used as an alternate authorization identity, or \
  otherwise functioning normally.

  for user ''{0}'' to ''{1}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_PW_CHANGED_TIME=Clear the password changed \
  time value for a user.  For password policy evaluations that require \
  knowing when the user's password was last changed, the server will attempt \
  to fall back to using the create timestamp, if available.

  for user ''{0}'' has been disabled by an administrator.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_SET_IS_DISABLED=Specify whether a user account is \
  administratively disabled.  A disabled account cannot authenticate or be \
  used as an alternate authorization identity.  This can also be accomplished \
  with a standard LDAP modify operation by setting the value of the \
  ds-pwp-account-disabled operational attribute in the user's entry with a \
  value of either true or false (or by removing the attribute from the user's \
  entry, which is equivalent to giving it a value of false).

  account administratively disabled.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_IS_DISABLED=Clear the account disabled state \
  information from a user entry, which is logically equivalent to using the \

  for user ''{0}'' to ''{1}''.
INFO_MANAGE_ACCT_SC_DESC_CLEAR_ACCT_ACT_TIME=Clear the account activation \
  time for a user.  If the account previously had an activation time in the \
  future, this will make it immediately eligible for use.  This can also be \
  accomplished with a standard LDAP modify operation by removing the \
  ds-pwp-account-activation-time attribute from the user's entry.

INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_CONTROLS=Control Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_DATA=Data Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_OPS=Operation Arguments
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=Applies a set of add, delete, modify, and/or \
  modify DN operations to a directory server.  The changes to apply should be \
  supplied in LDIF format, either via standard input or from a file specified \
  with the ''{0}'' argument.  Change records must be separated by at least \
  one blank line.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ALLOW_UNDELETE=Treat any add operation that \
  includes the ''{0}'' attribute as an undelete operation.  Undelete requests \
  may be used to restore a soft-deleted entry, optionally using a different \
  DN than was originally assigned to the entry.  The server must be \
  configured to allow soft delete operations, and the requester must have the \
  soft-delete-read privilege.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPLICATION=Indicates that all \
  operation requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'assured \
  replication' request control to indicate that the server should delay \
  returning a response to the client until a minimum amount of replication \
  processing has been performed for the operation.  The ''--{0}'', ''--{1}'', \
  and ''--{2}'' arguments may be used to configure the settings to use for \
  the assured replication control, but the server will automatically \
  determine an appropriate value for any argument that is not provided.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_AUTHZ_IDENTITY=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the 'authorization identity' request control as \
  defined in RFC 3829.  With this control, a successful bind result should \
  include the authorization identity assigned to the connection.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR=Continue processing changes \
  even if an error is encountered.  If this is not provided, then processing \
  will abort after the first failed operation.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DEFAULT_ADD=Assume that any LDIF change \
  record without a changeType represents an add operation.  If this is not \
  provided, then any change record without a changeType will be considered an \
  error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DRY_RUN=Parse the LDIF representations of the \
  changes to apply but don't actually perform any LDAP communication.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FOLLOW_REFERRALS=Attempt to follow any \
  referrals encountered while processing changes.  If this is not provided, \
  then any referral received will be considered an error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTR=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'get authorization \
  entry' request control to request that the server return the specified \
  attribute (or collection of attributes, in the case of a special identifier \
  like '*' to indicate all user attributes or '+' to indicate all \
  operational attributes) from the authenticated user's entry.  This argument \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to request.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS=Indicates that all \
  bind requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'get user resource \
  limits' request control to request that the server return  information \
  about resource limits (e.g., size limit, time limit, idle time limit, etc.) \
  imposed for the user.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_HARD_DELETE=Indicates that all delete \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'hard delete' request \
  control, which will permanently delete the target entry even if the \
  server would have otherwise performed a soft delete operation to hide the \
  entry for a period of time before deleting it.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_IGNORE_NO_USER_MOD=Indicates that all add \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'ignore \
  NO-USER-MODIFICATION' request control to permit setting values for certain \
  operational attributes not normally permitted to be provided by external \
  clients.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_VERSION=Specifies the LDAP protocol \
  version that the tool should use when communicating with the directory \
  server.  This argument has no effect and is provided only for the purpose \
  of compatibility with other ldapmodify tools.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Indicates that all \
  requests should include the manageDsaIT request control to indicate that \
  referral entries should be treated as regular entries.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_NAME_WITH_ENTRY_UUID=Include the \
  UnboundID-proprietary 'name with entryUUID' request control in all add \
  requests sent to the server to indicate that the server should use the \
  entryUUID operational attribute as the naming attribute for the resulting \
  entry instead of the provided RDN.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_NO_OPERATION=Include the LDAP no-operation \
  control in all add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests sent to the \
  server to indicate that the operation should be validated but no changes \
  should actually be applied.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PASSWORD_POLICY=Indicates that all add, bind \
  and modify requests should include the 'password policy' request control \
  (as defined in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-10) to request that the \
  response include password policy-related information about the target entry.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_NAME_EQUALS_VALUE={name=value}
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PW_UPDATE_BEHAVIOR=Specifies that all add and \
  modify requests should include the password update behavior request control \
  with the specified behavior.  Values for this argument must be in the form \
  'name=value', where the property name can be any of the following:  \
  is-self-change, allow-pre-encoded-password, skip-password-validation, \
  ignore-password-history, ignore-minimum-password-age, \
  password-storage-scheme, and must-change-password.  The value for each \
  property should be either 'true' or 'false', with the exception of the \
  password-storage-scheme property, whose value should be the name of the \
  desired password storage scheme.  This argument can be provided multiple \
  times to specify multiple password update behaviors.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PASSWORD_VALIDATION_DETAILS=Indicates that \
  all add and modify requests that target either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' \
  attribute should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'password validation \
  details' request control to indicate that the response should include \
  information about the password quality requirements that the server will \
  impose for the target user's password and whether the provided password \
  satisfies each of those constraints.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERMISSIVE_MODIFY=Indicates that all modify \
  operation requests should include the 'permissive modify' request \
  control, which indicates that the server should be more lenient for certain \
  types of changes (e.g., trying to add an attribute value that already \
  exists, or trying to remove a value that does not exist) that would \
  normally cause the modify operation to be rejected.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PURGE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Indicates that any \
  modify operation that targets either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' attribute \
  should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'purge current password' request \
  control.  This will indicate that the server should could purge the \
  current password from the entry (even if it would have otherwise been \
  retired for a brief period of time).
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REPLICATION_REPAIR=Indicates that all \
  operation requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'replication \
  repair' request control.  This will cause the change to be applied only to \
  the target directory server instance but not to any other server in the \
  replication topology.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETIRE_CURRENT_PASSWORD=Indicates that any \
  modify operation that targets either the ''{0}'' or ''{1}'' attribute \
  should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'retire current password' \
  request control.  This will indicate that the server should continue to \
  allow the user to authenticate with their current password (in addition to \
  the new password) for a brief period of time.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETRY_FAILED_OPERATIONS=Indicates that, if an \
  operation fails in a way that indicates the connection to the server may no \
  longer be valid, the tool should automatically create a new connection and \
  re-try the operation before reporting it as a failure.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the tool \
  should operate in script-friendly mode.  This argument has no effect and is \
  provided only for the purpose of compatibility with other ldapmodify tools.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SOFT_DELETE=Indicates that all delete \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'soft delete' request \
  control, which indicates that the server should hide the entry for a \
  period of time before deleting it so that it may be restored with an \
  undelete operation if the delete should be reverted.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Indicates that the tool \
  should strip any illegal trailing spaces from LDIF records before \
  attempting to process them.  If this is not provided, then any LDIF record \
  with one or more illegal trailing spaces will be considered an error.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUBTREE_DELETE=Indicates that all delete \
  requests should include the 'subtree delete' request control.  In the \
  event that the target entry includes one or more subordinate entries, this \
  control will indicate that the server should automatically remove all of \
  those entries as well.  If an entry has one or more subordinates but this \
  control is not provided, then an attempt to delete that entry will fail.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_REFERINT_UPDATES=Indicates that the \
  tool should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'suppress referential \
  integrity updates' request control in all delete and modify DN operations \
  to indicate that the server should not perform any referential integrity \
  processing for those operations.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Indicates that the tool \
  should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations \
  using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying \
  to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal \
  worker threads are busy processing other requests.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_TRANSACTION=Indicates that the server \
  should create a transaction to process all operations as a single atomic \
  unit.  This should generally only be used with a relatively small number of \
  changes, and it is recommended that the changes be supplied in an LDIF file \
  rather than via standard input.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSURED_REPL_TIMEOUT=Specifies the timeout to \
  use for assured replication processing.  This should only be used if the \
  ''{0}'' argument is also provided.  If assured replication is to be used \
  but this argument is not provided, then the server will automatically \
  determine the timeout to use.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_ATTR=Indicates that all add, modify, \
  and modify DN requests should include a uniqueness request control that \
  indicates that the server should attempt to prevent the requested operation \
  from introducing a conflict with the same value in an existing entry.  This \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple unique attribute types, \
  and in that case the '--uniquenessMultipleAttributeBehavior' argument may \
  be used to specify the behavior to exhibit for conflicts across those \
  attribute types.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_FILTER=Indicates that all add, modify \
  and modify DN requests should include a uniqueness request control that \
  indicates that the server should attempt to prevent the requested \
  operation from introducing a conflict with other entries matching the \
  provided filter.  If the '--uniquenessAttribute' argument is provided, then \
  this filter will be used to narrow the set of potentially conflicting \
  entries to only those that also match this filter.  If the \
  '--uniquenessAttribute' argument is not provided, then the server will \
  consider it a conflict if any other entry matches the provided filter.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_BASE_DN=Specifies the base DN that \
  should be included in the uniqueness request control.  This can only be \
  used if at least one of the '--uniquenessAttribute' or '--uniquenessFilter' \
  arguments is provided.  If this is not given, the server will look for \
  uniqueness conflicts within all public naming contexts.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_BEHAVIOR={behavior}
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_MULTIPLE_ATTRIBUTE_BEHAVIOR=Specifies \
  the behavior that the server should exhibit if the multiple unique \
  attribute types are configured.  This can only be used if the \
  '--uniquenessAttribute' argument is provided.  Allowed values for this \
  argument are 'unique-within-each-attribute' (to indicate that each \
  attribute should be considered separately), \
  'unique-across-all-attributes-including-in-same-entry' (to indicate that \
  the value of one unique attribute cannot also be present in the value of \
  any other unique attributes, even if the conflicting values are in the same \
  entry), 'unique-across-all-attributes-except-in-same-entry' (to indicate \
  that the value of one unique attribute cannot also be present in the value \
  of any other unique attribute, although the same entry will be permitted to \
  have the same value in multiple attributes), or 'unique-in-combination' (to \
  indicate that no other entry will be permitted to have the same combination \
  of unique attribute values).  If this is not specified, then a default \
  of 'unique-within-each-attribute' will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_PLACEHOLDER_LEVEL={level}
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_PRE_COMMIT_LEVEL=Specifies the \
  level of pre-commit validation that should be used for the uniqueness \
  request control.  This can only be used if at least one of the \
  '--uniquenessAttribute' or '--uniquenessFilter' arguments is provided.  \
  Allowed values for this argument are 'none' (to indicate that no pre-commit \
  validation should be performed), 'all-subtree-views' (to indicate that \
  a minimum of one pre-commit check should be performed in each applicable \
  subtree view), 'all-backend-sets' (to indicate that a minimum of one \
  pre-commit check should be performed in each entry-balancing backend set), \
  and 'all-available-backend-servers' (to indicate that the pre-commit check \
  should be made in all backend servers available through the Directory Proxy \
  Server).  If this is not specified, then a default of 'all-subtree-views' \
  will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_UNIQUE_POST_COMMIT_LEVEL=Specifies the \
  level of post-commit validation that should be used for the uniqueness \
  request control.  This can only be used if at least one of the \
  '--uniquenessAttribute' or '--uniquenessFilter' arguments is provided.  \
  Allowed values for this argument are 'none' (to indicate that no \
  post-commit validation should be performed), 'all-subtree-views' (to \
  indicate that a minimum of one post-commit check should be performed in \
  each applicable subtree view), 'all-backend-sets' (to indicate that a \
  minimum of one post-commit check should be performed in each \
  entry-balancing backend set), and 'all-available-backend-servers' (to \
  indicate that the post-commit check should be made in all backend servers \
  available through the Directory Proxy Server).  If this is not specified, \
  then a default of 'all-subtree-views' will be used.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ADD_CONTROL=Specifies a control that should \
  be included in all add requests sent to the server.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_BIND_CONTROL=Specifies a control that should \
  be included in all bind requests used to authenticate to the server.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DELETE_CONTROL=Specifies a control that \
  should be included in all delete requests sent to the server.
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MODIFY_CONTROL=Specifies a control that \
  should be included in all modify requests sent to the server.

  all add, delete, modify, and modify DN requests should be sent to the \
  server in a single multi-update request with the specified error behavior.  \
  The value for this argument must be one of 'atomic' (to indicate that all \
  updates should be processed atomically so that they will either all \
  succeed or all fail), 'abort-on-error' (to indicate that the server \
  should only process changes until the first error is encountered and ignore \
  any remaining changes after that error), or 'continue-on-error' (to \
  indicate that the server should continue attempting to process changes, \
  even after one of them has resulted in a failure).
INFO_LDAPMODIFY_ARG_DESCRIPTION_POST_READ_ATTRIBUTE=Indicates that all \
  add, modify, and modify DN requests should include the post-read control \

  processing the search, then the tool exit code will reflect the LDAP result \
  code received during search processing (or an appropriate client-side \
  result code if a problem was encountered before sending any searches).  \
  Note that because some operating systems do not allow exit code values \
  greater than 255, that will be the maximum exit value for this tool even if \
  more than 255 entries are returned.  Also note that this argument can only \
  be used when processing a single search.

  for searches used to join search result entries with related entries.  \
  The value may be one of 'search-base' to use the base DN of the search \
  request, 'source-entry-dn' to use the DN of the source entry as the base \
  DN for join searches, or any valid LDAP DN to use a custom base DN for join \
  searches.  If this is not specified, then the default join base DN will be \
  the search base DN.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_SCOPE=Specifies the scope to use for \
  searches used to join search result entries with related entries.  The \
  value may be one of 'base', 'one', 'sub', or 'subordinates'.  If this is \

  join scope.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_SIZE_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum number \
  of entries that the server will permit to be joined with any single search \
  result entry.  If this is not provided, the size limit from the search \
  request will be used.  Note that the server will impose a maximum join size \
  limit of 1000 entries, so any join size limit greater than that will be \
  limited to 1000.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_FILTER=Specifies an additional filter \
  that the server will require target entries to match in order to be joined \
  with the source entry.  If this is not provided, no additional join filter \
  will be used.

  indicates which attribute(s) should be included in entries joined with \
  search result entries.  The value may be an attribute name or OID, a \
  special token like '*' to indicate all user attributes or '+' to indicate \
  all operational attributes, or an object class name prefixed by an '@' \
  symbol to indicate all attributes associated with the specified object \
  class.  This may be provided multiple times to specify multiple requested \
  attributes.  If this is not specified, then the server will behave as if \
  all user attributes had been requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_JOIN_REQUIRE_MATCH=Indicates that the server \
  should not return an entry that matches the search criteria if it is not \
  joined with at least one additional entry.  If this is not provided, then \
  entries matching the search criteria will be returned even if they are not \
  joined with any other entries.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MANAGE_DSA_IT=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the manageDsaIT request control to indicate that \
  any referral entries in the scope of the search should be treated as \
  regular entries rather than causing the server to send search result \
  references.

  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'real attributes only' \
  request control to indicate that the server should not include any \
  virtual attributes in entries that are returned.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RETRY_FAILED_OPERATIONS=Indicates that, if a \
  search fails in a way that indicates the connection to the server may no \
  longer be valid, the tool should automatically create a new connection and \
  re-try the search before reporting it as a failure.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRIPT_FRIENDLY=Indicates that the tool \
  should operate in script-friendly mode.  This argument has no effect and is \
  provided only for the purpose of compatibility with other ldapsearch tools.

  written to standard output as well as to the output file specified via the \
  ''{0}'' argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_USE_ADMIN_SESSION=Indicates that the tool \
  should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations \
  using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying \
  to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal \
  worker threads are busy processing other requests.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_OP_ATTR_UPDATES=Indicates that \
  all operations should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'suppress \
  operational attribute updates' request control to indicate that the \

INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_EXCLUDE_BRANCH=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'exclude branch' \
  request control to indicate that matching entries below the specified \
  base DN should be excluded from search results.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times if multiple branches should be excluded.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FILTER_FILE=Specifies the path to a file \
  containing the search filters to issue.  Each filter should be on a \
  separate line.  Blank lines and lines beginning with the '#' character \
  will be ignored.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple filter files.  If a filter file is provided, then the first \
  trailing argument will not be interpreted as a search filter (all trailing \
  arguments will be interpreted as requested attributes).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_URL_FILE=Specifies the path to a file \
  containing LDAP URLs that define the search requests to issue.  The LDAP \
  URLs will specify the base DN, scope, filter, and attributes to return for \
  each search (any hostnames and port numbers included in the URLs will be \
  ignored).  Each URL should be on a separate line.  Blank lines and lines \
  beginning with the '#' character will be ignored.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple LDAP URL files.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FORMAT=Specifies the format that \
  should be used for the output generated by this tool.  Allowed values are \
  'LDIF' (LDAP Data Interchange Format, which is the standard string \
  representation for LDAP data), 'JSON' (JavaScript Object Notation, which is \
  a popular format used by web services), 'CSV' (comma-separated values, \
  which is a commonly-used format for text processing, and 'tab-delimited' \
  (another commonly-used general text format).  If either the 'CSV' or \
  'tab-delimited' format is selected, the set of requested attributes must be \
  provided with the ''{0}'' argument, the order in which the attributes are \
  provided on the command line specifies the order in which they will be \
  listed in the output, and if any of those attributes has multiple values \
  then only the first value will be used.  Further, the 'CSV' and \
  'tab-delimited' formats cannot be used in conjunction with the ''{1}'' \
  argument.  If no output format is specified, a default of 'LDIF' will be \
  used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OUTPUT_FILE=Specifies the path to the file to \
  which search results should be written.  If this argument is not provided \
  then results will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_COMPRESS_OUTPUT=Indicates that the output \
  should be gzip-compressed.  This can only be used if the --outputFile \
  argument is provided and the --teeResultsToStandardOut argument is not \
  provided.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT=Indicates that the output \
  should be encrypted with a key generated from a provided password.  This \
  can only be used if the --outputFile argument is provided and the \
  --teeResultsToStandardOut argument is not provided.  If the \
  --encryptionPassphraseFile argument is provided, then that file will be used \
  to specify the encryption passphrase; otherwise, the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ENCRYPTION_PW_FILE=The path to a file that \
  specifies the passphrase to use to encrypt the output.  This can only be \
  provided if the --encryptOutput argument is given, but if that argument is \
  given and no passphrase file is specified, then the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.  If a file is specified, then that file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line comprised entirely of the passphrase.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_ASSERTION_FILTER=A filter that will be used \
  in conjunction with the LDAP assertion request control (as described in RFC \
  4528) to indicate that the server should only process searches in which the \
  entry specified as the base DN matches this filter.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_FILTER=Specifies a filter to use when \
  processing a search.  This may be provided multiple times to issue multiple \
  searches with different filters.  If this argument is provided, then the \
  first trailing argument will not be interpreted as a search filter (all \
  trailing arguments will be interpreted as requested attributes).
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MATCHED_VALUES_FILTER=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the 'matched values' request control (as \
  described in RFC 3876) to indicate that search result entries should only \
  include values for a given attribute that match the provided filter.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple matched values \
  filters.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RATE_PER_SECOND=Specifies a maximum search \
  rate that the tool should be permitted to achieve.  Note that this limit \
  applies only to the rate at which the client issues search requests and not \
  to the rate at which the server may send matching entries.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PAGE_SIZE=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the 'simple paged results' control (as described in RFC \
  2696) to indicate that the search should return entries in pages of no more \
  than the specified size.  This can be useful for searches that must return \
  a large number of entries but the server restricts the number of entries \
  that may be returned for any search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SIZE_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum number of \
  entries that the server should return for each search.  A value of zero \
  (which is the default if this argument is not used) indicates that no \
  client-side size limit should be imposed.  Note that the server may impose \
  its own limit on the number of entries that may be returned for a search.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_TIME_LIMIT=Specifies the maximum length of \
  time in seconds that the server should spend processing each search.  A \
  value of zero (which is the default if this argument is not provided) \
  indicates that no client-side time limit should be imposed.  Note that the \
  server may impose its own time limit for search requests.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCOPE=Specifies the scope that to use for \
  search requests.  The value should be one of 'base', 'one', 'sub', or \
  'subordinates'.  If this argument is not provided, a default of 'sub' \
  will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_DEREFERENCE_POLICY=Specifies the alias \
  dereferencing policy to use for search requests.  The value should be one \
  of 'never', 'always', 'search', or 'find'.  If this argument is not \
  provided, a default of 'never' will be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_AUTHZ_ENTRY_ATTR=Indicates that all bind \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'get authorization \
  entry' request control to request that the server return the specified \
  attribute (or collection of attributes, in the case of a special identifier \
  like '*' to indicate all user attributes or '+' to indicate all \
  operational attributes) from the authenticated user's entry.  This argument \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to request.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_EFFECTIVE_RIGHTS_ATTR=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'get effective \
  rights' request control to return information about the access control \
  rights that a user has when interacting with each matching entry.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_GET_EFFECTIVE_RIGHTS_AUTHZID=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'get \
  effective rights' request control to return information about the \
  access control rights the specified user has when interacting with each \
  matching entry.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MATCHING_ENTRY_COUNT_CONTROL=Indicates that \
  all search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'matching \
  entry count' request control, which indicates that the server should \
  return information about the number of entries that match the search \
  criteria.  The maximum number of entries to examine must be specified, \
  which helps indicate whether an exact count or an estimate will be \
  returned.  If alwaysExamine is specified and the number of candidates is \
  less than the examine count, then each candidate will be examined to verify \
  that it matches the criteria and would actually be returned to the client \
  in a search.  If allowUnindexed is specified, then the count will be \
  allowed to be processed even if the search is unindexed (and may take a \
  very long time to complete).  If debug is specified, then additional debug \
  information may be included in the output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_OPERATION_PURPOSE=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary 'operation purpose' \
  request control to provide the specified reason for the operation.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERSISTENT_SEARCH=Indicates that the search \
  request should include the persistent search request control (as described \
  in draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch) to indicate that the server should return \
  information about changes to entries that match the search criteria as \
  they are processed.  This argument may only be used when processing a \
  single search operation.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_AS=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the proxied authorization request control (as described in \
  RFC 4370) to process the operation under an alternate authorization \
  identity.  The authorization ID should generally be specified in the form \
  'dn:' followed by the target user's DN, or 'u:' followed by the username.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PROXY_V1_AS=Indicates that all search \
  requests should include the legacy proxied authorization v1 request control \
  (as described in draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-04) to process the search under \
  an alternate authorization identity, specified as the DN of the desired user.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REQUESTED_ATTR=Specifies an identifier that \
  indicates which attribute(s) should be included in entries that match the \
  search criteria.  The value may be an attribute name or OID, a special \
  token like '*' to indicate all user attributes or '+' to indicate all \
  operational attributes, or an object class name prefixed by an '@' symbol \
  to indicate all attributes associated with the specified object class.  \
  This may be provided multiple times to specify multiple requested \
  attributes, and it may be provided instead of or in addition to the set of \
  requested attributes in the set of trailing arguments.  If this is not \
  specified, then the server will behave as if all user attributes had been \
  requested.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SORT_ORDER=Indicates that all search requests \
  should include the server-side sort request control (as described in RFC \
  2891) to request that the server sort results before returning them to the \
  client.  The sort order should be a comma-separated list of attribute \
  names, each of which may be optionally prefixed by '+' (to indicate that \
  sorting should be in ascending order for that attribute) or '-' (for \
  descending order), and may be optionally followed by a colon and the name \
  or OID for the ordering matching rule that should be used when sorting.  \
  Ascending order will be used if neither '+' or '-' is specified, and if no \
  matching rule ID is given then the attribute type's own ordering rule will \
  be used.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_VLV=Indicates that all search requests should \
  include the virtual list view (VLV) request control (as described in \
  draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv) to indicate that the server should return \
  the specified subset of the sorted search results (and the ''{0}'' argument \
  must also be given to specify the sort order).  The value should be a \
  colon-delimited list indicating which page of results to return, and it may \
  take one of two forms.  In either case, the first element specifies the \
  number of elements to return before the entry identified as the start of \
  the results, and the second is the number of entries after the "start" \
  entry.  The third element identifies the start of the result set, and it \
  may be either an integer offset (in which the first entry in the result \
  set has an offset of one), or a string that provides a value for which the \
  server should identify the first entry whose value for the primary sort \
  attribute is greater than or equal to the given string.  In the event that \
  an offset is provided, a fourth element must also be given to indicate the \
  expected number of entries in the result set, or zero if that is not \
  known.  For example, a value of '0:9:1:0' indicates that the server should \
  return the first ten entries of the result set (starting at offset 1, which \
  is the first entry, return the zero previous entries and the nine following \
  entries, with no indication of how many entries match the search \
  criteria).  Alternately, a value of '0:99:smith' indicates that the server \
  should the first 100 entries in the result set for which the primary sort \
  attribute has a value that is greater than or equal to 'smith'.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REJECT_UNINDEXED_SEARCH=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary reject unindexed \
  search request control to indicate that the server should not process the \
  search operation if it cannot do so efficiently using server indexes, even \
  if the requester has the unindexed-search privilege.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_PERMIT_UNINDEXED_SEARCH=Indicates that all \
  search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary permit unindexed \
  search request control to indicate that the server should process the \
  search operation even if it cannot do so efficiently using server indexes.  \
  The requester must have either the unindexed-search or \
  unindexed-search-with-control privilege.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_EXCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID \
  of an attribute that should be excluded from search result entries.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to \
  exclude.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_REDACT_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID of \
  an attribute whose values should be redacted to indicate that the attribute \
  is present in search result entries but to hide the actual values for that \
  attribute.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple attributes to redact.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_HIDE_REDACTED_VALUE_COUNT=Indicates that the \
  output should not reveal the number of values contained in redacted \
  attributes.  If this argument is present, then a redacted attribute will \
  only ever have a single value of '***REDACTED***'.  If this argument is not \
  present, then a redacted attribute with multiple values will still have \
  the same number of values that it originally had, but those values will \
  be '***REDACTED1***', '***REDACTED2***', etc.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_ATTRIBUTE=Specifies the name or OID \
  of an attribute whose values should be scrambled.  Scrambling will be \
  performed in a manner that attempts to preserve the associated attribute \
  syntax and that will generally try to ensure that a given input value will \
  consistently yield the same scrambled output.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to scramble.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_JSON_FIELD=Specifies the name of a \
  JSON field whose values should be scrambled.  If the --scrambleAttribute \
  argument is used to scramble any attributes whose values may be JSON \
  objects, then all JSON field names will be preserved and only the values of \
  the specified fields will be scrambled.  If this argument is given (and it \
  may be provided multiple times to target multiple JSON fields), then only \
  the specified fields will have their values scrambled.  If this argument \
  is not provided, then any of the scramble attribute values that are JSON \
  objects will have all values scrambled.  JSON field names will be treated \
  in a case-insensitive manner.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SCRAMBLE_RANDOM_SEED=Specifies the value that \
  will be used to seed the random number generator used in the course of \
  scrambling attribute values.  If a random seed is provided, then scrambling \
  the same entry with the same seed should consistently yield the same \
  scrambled representations.  If no random seed is specified, an appropriate \
  value will be selected automatically.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RENAME_ATTRIBUTE_FROM=Specifies the name or \
  OID of an attribute that should have its name replaced with the value \
  specified in the --renameAttributeTo argument.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times as long as the --renameAttributeTo argument is also \
  provided the same number of times, and the order of --renameAttributeFrom \
  values must correspond to the order of --renameAttributeTo values.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_RENAME_ATTRIBUTE_TO=Specifies the new name \
  to use for an attribute to be renamed.  This argument must be provided the \
  same number of times as the --renameAttributeFrom argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MOVE_SUBTREE_FROM=Specifies the base DN for \
  a subtree to be moved to another location in the DIT, with this source DN \
  being replaced with the base DN specified using the --moveSubtreeTo \
  argument.  This argument may be provided multiple times as long as the \
  --moveSubtreeTo argument is also provided the same number of times, and the \
  order of --moveSubtreeFrom values must correspond to the order of \
  --moveSubtreeTo values.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_MOVE_SUBTREE_TO=Specifies the new base DN for \
  a subtree to be moved.  This argument must be provided the same number of \
  times as the --moveSubtreeFrom argument.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LDAP_VERSION=Specifies the LDAP protocol \
  version that the tool should use when communicating with the directory \
  server.  This argument has no effect and is provided only for the purpose \
  of compatibility with other ldapsearch tools.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_ARGS_PLACEHOLDER={filter} [{attr1} [{attr2} ...]]
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_ARGS_WITH_URL_FILE=Trailing arguments are not allowed \
  when the ''{0}'' argument is provided.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_FILTER_WITH_FILTER_FILE=If a filter file is \
  specified, then a filter cannot be provided as a trailing argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_NO_TRAILING_ARGS=If neither the ''{0}'' nor the ''{1}'' \
  argument is provided, the filter to use for the search must be provided as \
  a trailing argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_FIRST_TRAILING_ARG_NOT_FILTER=The first trailing argument \
  ''{0}'' is not a valid LDAP search filter.
WARN_LDAPSEARCH_TRAILING_ARG_STARTS_WITH_DASH=WARNING:  Unnamed trailing \
  argument ''{0}'' starts with a dash.  Trailing arguments should only be \
  used for the search filter (unless a different argument is used to specify \
  the filters) and set of requested attributes to include in search result \
  entries.  If this was intended to be a named argument, it should be \
  placed earlier in the argument list.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_INVALID_MATCHED_VALUES_FILTER=Filter ''{0}'' is a valid \
  search filter, but is not valid for use with the matched values request \
  control.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MATCHING_ENTRY_COUNT_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid.  The value must start with 'examineCount=' \
  followed by an integer greater than or equal to zero.  It may optionally \
  also contain ':alwaysExamine' (to indicate that it should always attempt \
  to examine candidate entries to determine whether they actually match), \
  ':allowUnindexed' (to indicate that the server should attempt to \
  determine the matching entry count even if the search criteria is not \
  indexed), ':skipResolvingExplodedIndexes' (to indicate whether the server \
  should skip the effort of actually retrieving the candidate entry IDs for \
  exploded index keys in which the number of matching entries is known), \
  ':fastShortCircuitThreshold=' followed by an integer value (to specify the \
  short-circuit threshold that the server should use when determining whether \
  to continue with index processing, even if there may be additional filter \
  components that may be very fast to process), ':slowShortCircuitThreshold=' \
  followed by an integer value (to specify the short-circuit threshold that \
  should be used if it is expected that there may be potentially-expensive \
  filter components left to evaluate), and/or ':debug' (to indicate that the \
  response control should include debug information about the processing \
  performed in the course of making the determination.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_NO_EQUAL=A value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid because it does not contain an equal sign to separate \
  the property name from the value.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_EMPTY_PROPERTY_NAME=A value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid because it starts with an equal sign, \
  indicating an empty property name.  Property names must not be empty.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY_NAME=A value provided for \
  the ''{0}'' argument is invalid because there are multiple attempts to set \
  a value for property ''{1}''.  The same property cannot be set multiple \
  times.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OVERRIDE_LIMIT_EMPTY_PROPERTY_VALUE=A value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid because it contains an empty value for property \
  ''{1}''.  Property values must not be empty.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_PERSISTENT_SEARCH_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the \
  ''{0}'' argument is invalid.  The value must start with 'ps'.  That may be \
  followed by a colon and a comma-delimited list of change types ('add', \
  'delete', 'modify', or 'modifydn'), or 'any' to indicate that all change \
  types should be included.  That may be followed by a colon and a '1' to \
  indicate that the search should only return matching entries when they are \
  targeted by an appropriate operation, or '0' to indicate that the search \
  should first return all existing entries that match the criteria before \
  transitioning to returning to returning entries as updates occur.  That may \
  be followed by a colon and a '1' to request that the server include entry \
  change notification controls with search result entries, or '0' to request \
  no such controls.  A value of just 'ps' is equivalent to 'ps:any:1:1'.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_SORT_ORDER_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value must be a comma-delimited list of one or \
  more attribute names or OIDs, each of which may be prefixed by '-' to \
  indicate that sorting for that attribute should be in descending order, or \
  '+' to indicate that sorting for that attribute should be in ascending \
  order.  If an attribute name is not prefixed with either '-' or '+', then \
  sorting for that attribute will be in ascending order.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_VLV_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' argument \
  is invalid.  The value must either be a colon-delimited list of four \
  integers (representing the before count; after count; offset index; and \
  expected result set size, with zero used if the expected result set size is \
  not known), or a colon-delimited list of two integers and one string \
  (representing the before count, after count, and the primary sort attribute \
  value that should be used as the start of the result set).
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_JOIN_RULE_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value must be one of the following:  the string \
  'dn:' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the source entry whose \
  values are the DNs of the entries with which to join; the string \
  'reverse-dn:' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the target \
  entry with a value that matches the DN of the source entry; the string \
  'equals:' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the source entry, \
  a colon, and the name or OID of an attribute in target entries that must \
  have a value that equals at least one value of the source attribute; or the \
  string 'contains:' followed by the name or OID of an attribute in the \
  source entry, a colon, and the name or OID of an attribute in target \
  entries that must have a value that matches or contains as a substring at \
  least one value of the source attribute.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_JOIN_BASE_DN_INVALID_VALUE=The value provided for the ''{0}'' \
  argument is invalid.  The value may be 'search-base' to use the base DN \
  from the search request as the base DN for join searches, 'source-entry-dn' \
  to use the DN of the source entry as the base DN for join searches, or any \
  valid DN to use that DN as the base DN for join searches.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_RENAME_ATTRIBUTE_MISMATCH=The --renameAttributeFrom argument \
  must be provided the same number of times as the --renameAttributeTo \
  argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MOVE_SUBTREE_MISMATCH=The --moveSubtreeFrom argument must be \
  provided the same number of times as the --moveSubtreeTo argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED_WITH_URLS=The ''{0}'' output \
  format cannot be used in conjunction with the ''{1}'' argument.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT_REQUIRES_REQUESTED_ATTR_ARG=The ''{0}'' output \
  format requires that the set of requested arguments be identified with the \
  ''{1}'' argument rather than as unnamed trailing arguments.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_CANNOT_OPEN_OUTPUT_FILE=Unable to open output file ''{0}'' \
  for writing:  {1}
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_CANNOT_CREATE_CONNECTION_POOL=An error occurred while \
  attempting to create a connection pool to communicate with the directory \
  server:  {0}

  ''{1}'' that cannot be parsed as a valid LDAP URL.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_CANNOT_READ_LDAP_URL_FILE=An error occurred while attempting \
  to read from LDAP URL file ''{0}'':  {1}
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MALFORMED_FILTER=Filter file ''{0}'' contains a value that \
  cannot be parsed as a valid LDAP search filter:  {1}
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_CANNOT_READ_FILTER_FILE=An error occurred while attempting \
  to read from filter URL file ''{0}'':  {1}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_DRY_RUN_REQUEST_NOT_SENT=No search operation was actually \
  processed because the {0} argument was provided.  The request that would \
  have been sent is:  {1}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_SENDING_SEARCH_REQUEST=Sending search request {0}
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_MISSING_PAGED_RESULTS_RESPONSE_CONTROL=The search request \
  included the simple paged results request control, but the corresponding \
  search result did not include the expected response control.  It is not \
  possible to continue paging through the search results.
ERR_LDAPSEARCH_CANNOT_DECODE_PAGED_RESULTS_RESPONSE_CONTROL=An error occurred \
  while attempting to decode the simple paged results response control \
  included in the search result:  {0}.  It is not possible to continue \

  with more pages to retrieve:
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_TOTAL_SEARCH_ENTRIES=Total Entries Returned:  {0,number,0}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_TOTAL_SEARCH_REFERENCES=Total References Returned:  \
  {0,number,0}
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_1=Establishes an unencrypted LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:389, performs a simple bind to authenticate as user \
  'uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com', and issues a search request to \
  retrieve the givenName, sn, and mail attributes for the user with uid \
  'jqpublic' below dc=example,dc=com.  The search results will be written to \
  standard output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_2=Establishes an SSL-encrypted LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:636, interactively prompting the user about whether \
  to trust the certificate presented by the directory server.  The tool \
  will then bind with the SASL PLAIN mechanism using an authentication ID of \
  "u:jdoe" and a password read from a file.  It will then issue a search \
  request for each filter in a given file, writing the results for each \
  search into a separate output file.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_3=Establishes an LDAP connection to \
  directory.example.com:389 that is secured with the StartTLS extended \
  operation, using the information in the provided trust store file to \
  determine whether to trust the certificate presented by the directory \
  server.  It will then issue an unauthenticated search to retrieve all \
  user and operational attributes from the server's root DSE.  The output \
  will be written to a specified output file as well as displayed on standard \
  output.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_4=Issues a search request to retrieve all entries at \
  or below 'dc=example,dc=com', using the simple paged results control to \
  retrieve up to 100 entries at a time.  The search will use an unencrypted \
  LDAP connection, and the tool will interactively prompt the user for the \
  password to use when performing simple authentication.
INFO_LDAPSEARCH_EXAMPLE_5=Issues a search request to retrieve a \
  special entry that provides details about the server's use of indexes to \
  determine the candidate set of potential matching entries.  This feature \
  is only supported in the UnboundID/Ping Identity Directory Server, and \
  the user must have access control rights to retrieve the 'cn=debugsearch' \
  entry and the 'debugsearchindex' operational attribute.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=Splits a single LDIF file into multiple \
  sets by separating entries below a specified base DN into different \
  mutually-exclusive collections of entries.  A number of algorithms are \
  available to determine how entries should be split, and entries outside the \
  split base DN may be included in all sets or added to a dedicated LDIF file.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_LDIF=The path to an LDIF file \
  containing the data to be split into multiple sets.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple LDIF files, and the files will \
  be processed in the order they were provided on the command line.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_COMPRESSED=Indicates that the source \
  LDIF files are gzip-compressed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_TARGET_LDIF_BASE=The path and base name to \
  use for the LDIF files containing the data that has been split.  The \
  resulting LDIF files will use this path with different extensions ('.set1' \
  for the first set, '.set2' for the second set, and so on, and \
  '.outside-split-base-dn' if a file is to be created to hold entries that \
  exist outside of the split base DN).  If this is not provided, then the \
  source LDIF path will be used as the base name.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_TARGET=Indicates that the target \
  LDIF files should be gzip-compressed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_TARGET=Indicates that the target LDIF \
  LDIF files should be encrypted with a key generated from a provided \
  passphrase.  If the --encryptionPassphraseFile argument is provided, then \
  the passphrase will be read from the specified file.  Otherwise, it will be \
  interactively requested from the user.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_PW_FILE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.  This \
  passphrase will be used to decrypt the input (if it is encrypted) and to \
  encrypt the output (if it is to be encrypted).  If this is not provided and either the input or output is encrypted, then the passphrase will be \
  interactively requested.  If it is provided, then the specified file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line that is comprised entirely of the \
  encryption passphrase.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SPLIT_BASE_DN=The base DN below which entries \
  should be split.  The entry with this DN will appear in all sets, but each \
  entry below this base DN will appear in exactly one set.  This must be \
  provided.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_OUTSIDE_TO_ALL_SETS=Indicates that entries \
  outside the split base DN should be added to all sets containing split data.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_OUTSIDE_TO_DEDICATED_SET=Indicates that \
  entries outside the split base DN should be added to a dedicated set in its \
  own file.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH=The path to a file or directory \
  from which to read schema definitions to use when processing.  If the \
  provided path is a file, then it must be an LDIF file containing the \
  definitions to read.  If the provided path is a directory, then schema \
  definitions will be read from all files with an extension of '.ldif' in \
  that directory.  If this argument is provided multiple times, then the \
  paths will be processed in the order they were provided on the command \
  line.  If this argument is not provided, then a default standard schema \
  will be used.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_GLOBAL_ARG_DESC_NUM_THREADS=The number of threads to use when \
  processing.  If this is not specified, a single thread will be used.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_DESC=Splits the data by computing a hash on \
  the normalized representation of the DN component immediately below the \
  split base DN, and using a modulus operation to determine the set in which \
  to place the entry.  This split algorithm does not require any caching to \
  ensure that a subordinate entry is placed in the same set as its parent.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_RDN_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file 'whole.ldif' so that \
  entries below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' will be split into four sets, \
  selected by computing a digest of the RDN component immediately below \
  'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com', with names starting with 'split.ldif'.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_DESC=Splits the data by computing a hash on \
  the value(s) of a specified attribute in entries immediately below the \
  split base DN, and using a modulus operation to determine the set in which \
  to place the entry.  If an entry does not contain the target attribute, the \
  set will be chosen based on a hash of the DN component immediately below \
  the split base DN.  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT argument is provided, a \
  cache will be used to ensure that subordinate entries are added into the \
  same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ATTR_NAME=The name or OID of the \
  attribute for which to compute the hash.  This must be provided.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ALL_VALUES=Indicates that the \
  hashing process should examine all values for the target attribute.  If \
  this argument is not provided, then only the first value for the attribute \
  will be used to determine the set in which an entry should be placed.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the \
  tool should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly \
  one level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache \
  to determine where a subordinate entry's parent resides.  If this argument \
  is provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then then will \
  be added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually \
  identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_HASH_ON_ATTR_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file 'whole.ldif' so that \
  entries below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' will be split into four sets, \
  selected by computing a digest of the first value of the 'uid' attribute, \
  with names starting with 'split.ldif'.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_DESC=Splits the data by selecting the \
  set with the fewest number of entries.  When processing data in a flat DIT, \
  this will essentially be a round-robin distribution.  When processing data \
  in a DIT with branches of varying sizes, this can help ensure that the \
  resulting LDIF files will have roughly the same number of entries (although \
  running the tool with multiple threads may make this less accurate).  \
  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT argument is provided, a cache will be used to \
  ensure that subordinate entries are added into the same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_ARG_DESC_NUM_SETS=The number of sets into \
  which the data should be split.  This must be provided, and the value must \
  be greater than or equal to two.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the \
  tool should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly \
  one level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache \
  to determine where a subordinate entry's parent resides.  If this argument \
  is provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then then will \
  be added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually \
  identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FEWEST_ENTRIES_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file 'whole.ldif' into \
  four sets, with names starting with 'split.ldif', so that each entry \
  immediately below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' will be placed in the set \
  that currently has the fewest entries.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_DESC=Splits the data by using search filters to \
  select the appropriate set.  The filters will be evaluated in the order \
  they were provided on the command line, and the entry will be added to the \
  first set for which a matching filter is found.  If the entry doesn't match \
  any of the provided filters, then the appropriate set will be determined by \
  computing a hash on the RDN.  Unless the --assumeFlatDIT argument is \
  provided, a cache will be used to ensure that subordinate entries are added \
  into the same set as their parents.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_ARG_DESC_FILTER=A filter to evaluate against \
  entries exactly one level below the split base DN to determine which set \
  should be used to hold the entry.  This argument should be provided \
  multiple times, once for each set into which the data should be split, and \
  the filters will be evaluated in the order they were provided on the \
  command line until one is found that matches the target entry.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_ARG_DESC_ASSUME_FLAT_DIT=Indicates that the tool \
  should assume that all entries below the split base DN will be exactly one \
  level below that entry, so that it is not necessary to maintain a cache to \
  determine where a subordinate entry's parent resides.  If this argument is \
  provided but one or more subordinate entries are found, then then will be \
  added to a separate file so the appropriate set can be manually identified.
INFO_SPLIT_LDIF_SC_FILTER_EXAMPLE=Splits LDIF file 'whole.ldif' into four \
  sets, with names starting with 'split.ldif', so that each entry \
  immediately below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' will be selected by \
  matching that entry against a search filter.  Entries matching \
  '(timeZone=Eastern)' will go into the first set, entries matching \
  '(timeZone=Central)' into the second set, '(timeZone=Mountain)' into the \
  third set, and '(timeZone=Pacific)' into the fourth.  Any entries not \
  matching any of those filters will be placed by computing a hash on its RDN.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NO_TARGET_BASE_PATH=If the {0} argument is provided multiple \
  times, then the {1} argument must also be provided to specify the base \
  path and name for the file to be written.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NON_UNIQUE_FILTER=All values provided for the ''{0}'' argument \
  must be unique.  Filter ''{1}'' was provided multiple times.
ERR_SPLIT_LDIF_NOT_ENOUGH_FILTERS=If the ''{0}'' subcommand is used, the \
  ''{1}'' argument must be provided multiple times, with each occurrence \
  defining the criteria for a different set.
