  authenticating but optionally including a trace string that may help \
  provide information about the client.
INFO_SASL_ANONYMOUS_OPTION_TRACE=A trace string that may be used to provide \
  additional information about the client performing the bind.  Note, \
  however, that because the client is not providing any proof of its \
  identity, it is not possible to determine the validity of any trace \
  information given.
INFO_SASL_CRAM_MD5_DESCRIPTION=A mechanism that can be used to perform \
  password-based authentication in a manner that prevents an observer from \
  discovering the password by generating an MD5 digest based on the \
  provided password and additional information, including random data \
  provided by the server.
INFO_SASL_CRAM_MD5_OPTION_AUTH_ID=A string that identifies the user that is \
  trying to authenticate.  The value is typically in the form ''dn:'' \
  followed by the DN of the target user''s entry, or ''u:'' followed by the \
  username for the target user.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_DESCRIPTION=A mechanism that can be used to perform \
  password-based authentication in a manner that prevents an observer from \
  discovering the password by generating an MD5 digest based on the \
  provided password and additional information, including random data \
  provided by both the client and the server.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_OPTION_AUTH_ID=A string that identifies the user that \
  is trying to authenticate.  The value is typically in the form ''dn:'' \
  followed by the DN of the target user''s entry, or ''u:'' followed by the \
  username for the target user.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_OPTION_AUTHZ_ID=A string that identifies the user under \
  whose authority subsequent operations should be processed.  If this is not \
  provided, then no alternate authorization identity will be used.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_OPTION_REALM=The realm for the user trying to \
  authenticate.  If this is not provided, then no realm will be specified in \
  the bind request.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_OPTION_QOP=The quality of protection that should be used \
  for any communication that occurs after the authentication has completed.  \
  Allowed values are ''auth'' (for just authentication with no communication \
  protection), ''auth-int'' (for integrity protection for communication, \
  which does not encrypt but ensures that the communication cannot be \
  imperceptibly altered by a man in the middle attack), and ''auth-conf'' \
  (for confidentiality protection for communication, which encrypts the \
  communication so that it cannot be deciphered by a third-party observer).  \
  If no value is specified, then a default of ''auth'' will be assumed.  If \
  any of multiple qualities of protection will be considered acceptable then \
  the permissible QoP values may be separated by commas and listed in order \
  from most desirable to least desirable.

  authenticate to the server using information that the server may have about \
  the client which was not provided in the form of an LDAP message (e.g., \
  a client certificate that was presented during an SSL or StartTLS handshake).
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_DESCRIPTION=A mechanism that can allow the client to \
  authenticate to the server using Kerberos V.  It may be possible to \
  leverage an existing Kerberos session or to authenticate using a \
  newly-created session.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_AUTH_ID=A string that identifies the user that is \
  trying to authenticate.  This should generally be the user''s Kerberos \
  principal.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_AUTHZ_ID=A string that identifies the user under \
  whose authority subsequent operations should be processed.  If this is not \
  provided, then no alternate authorization identity will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_CONFIG_FILE=The path to a file containing the JAAS \
  configuration that will be used for Kerberos processing.  if this is not \
  specified then an automatically-generated JAAS configuration will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_DEBUG=Indicates whether JAAS and Kerberos processing \
  debug information may be written to standard error.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_KDC_ADDRESS=The address of the Kerberos KDC that \
  should be used during authentication processing.  If this is not provided, \
  then an attempt will be made to determine the appropriate KDC address from \
  the underlying system configuration.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_PROTOCOL=The name of the protocol used in the \
  directory server''s service principal.  If this is not provided, then a \
  default protocol of ''ldap'' will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_REALM=The name of the Kerberos realm in which the \
  authentication will be processed.  if this is not provided, then an \
  attempt will be made to determine the appropriate realm from the underlying \
  system configuration.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_QOP=The quality of protection that should be used \
  for any communication that occurs after the authentication has completed.  \
  Allowed values are ''auth'' (for just authentication with no communication \
  protection), ''auth-int'' (for integrity protection for communication, \
  which does not encrypt but ensures that the communication cannot be \
  imperceptibly altered by a man in the middle attack), and ''auth-conf'' \
  (for confidentiality protection for communication, which encrypts the \
  communication so that it cannot be deciphered by a third-party observer).  \
  If no value is specified, then a default of ''auth'' will be assumed.  If \
  any of multiple qualities of protection will be considered acceptable then \
  the permissible QoP values may be separated by commas and listed in order \
  from most desirable to least desirable.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_RENEW_TGT=Indicates whether to attempt to renew the \
  client''s Kerberos ticket-granting ticket if authentication succeeds using \
  an existing Kerberos session.  If this is not provided, then no attempt \
  will be made to renew the TGT.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_REQUIRE_TICKET_CACHE=Indicates whether the client \
  will be required to have an existing Kerberos session that will be used \
  for the authentication rather than using a newly-created session.  This \
  option will only be examined if a ticket cache should be used during \
  authentication processing.  If this is not provided, then an existing \
  Kerberos session will not be required.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_TICKET_CACHE=Specifies the path to a ticket cache \
  file that should be used to look for an existing Kerberos session.  This \
  option will only be examined if a ticket cache should be used during \
  authentication processing.  If this is not provided, then the default \
  ticket cache file path will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_USE_TICKET_CACHE=Indicates whether to attempt to use \
  a ticket cache in order to determine whether the user has an existing \
  Kerberos session that may be used instead of using a newly-created session.

  authenticate with an OAuth 2.0 access token.
INFO_SASL_OAUTHBEARER_OPTION_ACCESS_TOKEN=The OAuth 2.0 access token to use \

  password-based authentication, optionally using an alternate authorization \
  identity.

  whose authority subsequent operations should be processed.  If this is not \
  provided, then no alternate authorization identity will be used.
INFO_SASL_SCRAM_SHA_1_DESCRIPTION=A salted challenge-response authentication \
  mechanism that can allow the client to perform password-based \
  authentication in a manner that proves that the client knows the password \
  without transferring the password in the clear, while allowing the server \
  to store the password in a non-reversible form, and also requiring the \
  client to perform multiple rounds of processing to make guessing attacks \
  more expensive.  This variant uses the SHA-1 digest algorithm in the course \
  of computing the password.
INFO_SASL_SCRAM_SHA_256_DESCRIPTION=A salted challenge-response \
  authentication mechanism that can allow the client to perform \
  password-based authentication in a manner that proves that the client knows \
  the password without transferring the password in the clear, while allowing \
  the server to store the password in a non-reversible form, and also \
  requiring the client to perform multiple rounds of processing to make \
  guessing attacks more expensive.  This variant uses the 256-bit SHA-2 \
  digest algorithm in the course of computing the password.
INFO_SASL_SCRAM_SHA_512_DESCRIPTION=A salted challenge-response \
  authentication mechanism that can allow the client to perform \
  password-based authentication in a manner that proves that the client knows \
