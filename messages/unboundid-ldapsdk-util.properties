  additional information about the client performing the bind.  Note, \
  however, that because the client is not providing any proof of its \

  provided by the server.
INFO_SASL_CRAM_MD5_OPTION_AUTH_ID=A string which identifies the user that is \

  by the DN of the target user's entry, or "u:" followed by the username for \
  the target user.

  password-based authentication in a manner that prevents an observer from \
  discovering the password by generating an MD5 digest based on the \
  provided password and additional information, including random data \
  provided by both the client and the server.

  the bind request.
INFO_SASL_DIGEST_MD5_OPTION_QOP=The quality of protection that should be used \
  for any communication that occurs after the authentication has completed.  \
  Allowed values are 'auth' (for just authentication with no communication \
  protection), 'auth-int' (for integrity protection for communication, which \
  does not encrypt but ensures that the communication cannot be imperceptibly \
  altered by a man in the middle attack), and 'auth-conf' (for \
  confidentiality protection for communication, which encrypts the \
  communication so that it cannot be deciphered by a third-party observer).  \
  If no value is specified, then a default of 'auth' will be assumed.  If any \
  of multiple qualities of protection will be considered acceptable then the \
  permissible QoP values may be separated by commas and listed in order from \
  most desirable to least desirable.

  authenticate to the server using information that the server may have about \

  trying to authenticate.  This should generally be the user's Kerberos \
  principal.

  whose authority subsequent operations should be processed.  If this is not \
  provided, then no alternate authorization identity will be used.

  configuration that will be used for Kerberos processing.  if this is not \
  specified then an automatically-generated JAAS configuration will be used.

  debug information may be written to standard error.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_KDC_ADDRESS=The address of the Kerberos KDC that \
  should be used during authentication processing.  If this is not provided, \
  then an attempt will be made to determine the appropriate KDC address from \
  the underlying system configuration.

  directory server's service principal.  If this is not provided, then a \
  default protocol of "ldap" will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_REALM=The name of the Kerberos realm in which the \
  authentication will be processed.  if this is not provided, then an \
  attempt will be made to determine the appropriate realm from the underlying \
  system configuration.

  for any communication that occurs after the authentication has completed.  \
  Allowed values are 'auth' (for just authentication with no communication \
  protection), 'auth-int' (for integrity protection for communication, which \
  does not encrypt but ensures that the communication cannot be imperceptibly \
  altered by a man in the middle attack), and 'auth-conf' (for \
  confidentiality protection for communication, which encrypts the \
  communication so that it cannot be deciphered by a third-party observer).  \
  If no value is specified, then a default of 'auth' will be assumed.  If any \
  of multiple qualities of protection will be considered acceptable then the \
  permissible QoP values may be separated by commas and listed in order from \
  most desirable to least desirable.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_RENEW_TGT=Indicates whether to attempt to renew the \
  client's Kerberos ticket-granting ticket if authentication succeeds using \
  an existing Kerberos session.  If this is not provided, then no attempt \
  will be made to renew the TGT.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_REQUIRE_TICKET_CACHE=Indicates whether the client \
  will be required to have an existing Kerberos session that will be used \
  for the authentication rather than using a newly-created session.  This \
  option will only be examined if a ticket cache should be used during \
  authentication processing.  If this is not provided, then an existing \
  Kerberos session will not be required.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_TICKET_CACHE=Specifies the path to a ticket cache \
  file that should be used to look for an existing Kerberos session.  This \
  option will only be examined if a ticket cache should be used during \
  authentication processing.  If this is not provided, then the default \
  ticket cache file path will be used.
INFO_SASL_GSSAPI_OPTION_USE_TICKET_CACHE=Indicates whether to attempt to use \
  a ticket cache in order to determine whether the user has an existing \
  Kerberos session that may be used instead of using a newly-created session.

  password-based authentication, optionally using an alternate authorization \
  identity.

  whose authority subsequent operations should be processed.  If this is not \
  provided, then no alternate authorization identity will be used.

  option because it is missing an equal sign to separate the name from the \
  value.
ERR_SASL_OPTION_STARTS_WITH_EQUAL=Unable to parse string ''{0}'' as a SASL \

  Arguments
ERR_COMMAND_LINE_TOOL_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED=A shutdown hook was \
  invoked for command-line tool ''{0}'' but the doShutdownHookProcessing \

  definition file with comments that describe the required format for this \
  file.
INFO_RATE_ADJUSTOR_GENERATE_SAMPLE_RATE_FILE_ARG_DESCRIPTION=The path to a \
  sample variable data rate file that should be generated.  This file will \
  contain comments that describe the expected format for the file to use \

  keys:  {0}. The supported keys are {1}.
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_MISSING_FORMAT=The rate input did not include a value for \

  of these values:  {1}.  All header lines must appear at the beginning of \
  the file and must take the form ''{2} key=value''.

  be parsed as a duration value:  {1}
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_INVALID_LINE=Input line ''{0}'' has an invalid format.  All \

  duration'' (e.g., ''1000, 1m'') or ''relative-rate, duration'' \
  (e.g., ''2.5X, 1d''), where the rate is a multiplier on the baseline rate \
  per second.  The duration can be omitted if a {1} value is provided in the \
  header
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_INVALID_RATE=Rate ''{0}'' from input line ''{1}'' could not \
  be parsed as a floating point value
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_RELATIVE_RATE_WITHOUT_BASELINE=Rate ''{0}'' from \
  input line ''{1}'' specified a relative rate.  This is not supported because \
  the target rate per second was not provided (e.g., using the \
  ''--ratePerSecond'' command-line argument).
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_INVALID_DURATION=Duration ''{0}'' from input line ''{1}'' \
  could not be parsed as a duration value:  {2}
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_HEADER_NO_EQUAL=Header line ''{0}'' is malformed because it \
  does not include an equal sign to separate the header key from its value.
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_HEADER_EMPTY_KEY=Header line ''{0}'' is malformed because \
  the key is an empty string.
ERR_RATE_ADJUSTOR_DUPLICATE_HEADER_KEY=Header key ''{0}'' already has a value \
  of ''{1}''.  Cannot also set it to ''{2}''.
