INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ELEMENT_TYPE='{'elementType'}'
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOWED_ELEMENT_TYPE=A type of schema element \

  values include:  ''attribute-syntax'', ''matching-rule'', \
  ''attribute-type'', ''object-class'', ''name-form'', ''dit-content-rule'', \

  provided, then no element types will be prohibited.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_REDEFINING=Allow a schema element to be \
  defined multiple times.  If this is provided, then subsequent definitions \
  of a schema elements will override previous definitions of the same \
  element.  By default, each schema element may only be defined once.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_UNDEFINED=A type of schema element that \
  may be referenced by an element read from a schema file but that has not \
  been defined in the schema files being read.  This may be provided multiple \
  times if multiple types of undefined elements should be allowed.  Allowed \
  values include:  ''attribute-syntax'', ''matching-rule'', \
  ''attribute-type'', ''object-class'', ''name-form'', ''dit-content-rule'', \

  have non-numeric object identifiers.  Although this is technically not \
  valid, some servers allow the use of non-numeric OIDs.

INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_LENIENT_NAMES=Use lenient validation for \

  servers have more lax name requirements.  If this option is provided, then \
  schema element names will also be permitted to have underscores, and will \
  be permitted to start with any allowed character.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_AT_WITHOUT_SYNTAX=Allow attribute type \
  definitions that do not directly specify a syntax and do not inherit the \

  some servers may assume a default equality matching rule based on the \
  syntax), which may not be the desired behavior.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_MISSING_MISSING_OC_SUP=Allow structural \
  object classes that do not superior class.  All structural object classes \

  or abstract, but some servers may assume a default superior object class of \
  ''top'' for any structural class that does not explicitly specify one.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_REJECT_MULTIPLE_OC_SUP=Reject object classes \
  that have multiple superior classes.  Although this is valid, some servers \
  do not support object classes with multiple superiors.
INFO_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ARG_DESC_ALLOW_EMPTY_DESC=Allow schema elements with an \
  empty string as the value for the ''DESC'' element.  LDAP does not allow \
  schema element definitions to contain empty quoted strings, but some \
  servers allow them to have empty descriptions.
ERR_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_NO_SUCH_ELEMENT_TYPE=An invalid value of ''{0}'' was \

ERR_VALIDATE_SCHEMA_ALL_ELEMENT_TYPES_PROHIBITED=Although the ''{0}'' \
