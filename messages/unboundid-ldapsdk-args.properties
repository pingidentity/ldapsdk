  used to specify default values for arguments.
INFO_ARG_DESCRIPTION_NO_PROP_FILE=Do not obtain any argument values from a \
  properties file.
INFO_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SUPPRESS_PROP_FILE_COMMENT=Suppress output listing the \
  arguments obtained from a properties file.
ERR_PARSER_NO_SUCH_PROPERTIES_FILE=The {0} argument was provided to indicate \
  that argument values should be obtained from properties file {1}, but \
  either that file does not exist or the path exists but does not refer to a \
  file.
ERR_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE=An error occurred while attempting to \
  open file ''{0}'' for writing:  {1}
INFO_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_HEADER_1=This file may be used to specify default \
  values to use for {0} arguments that were not provided by the command \
  line.  Note that although it was generated for the {0} tool, it may contain \
  default values for any number of other tools that use the same arguments.  \
  This allows a single properties file to be used in conjunction with \
  multiple tools.  The should be encoded using the ISO 8859-1 character set.  \
  Any characters that cannot be directly represented in that character set \
  may be encoded as a backslash followed by a lowercase letter u and the four \
  hexadecimal digits that make up the Unicode representation of that \
  character (for example, \\u0000 for the Unicode null character).
INFO_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_HEADER_2=When invoking an applicable tool like {0}, you \
  may indicate that this properties file should be used by launching the tool \
  with the {1} argument and specifying the path to this file.  Alternately, \
  the {2} Java property or the {3} environment variable may be set to the \
  path to the properties file that should be used.  The {4} argument may be \
  used to indicate that the tool should not use any properties file and that \
  it should only use the argument values provided on the command line.
INFO_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_HEADER_3=Each property listed in this file should be a \
  name-value pair in which the name and the value are separated by an equal \
  sign.  The name of the property should be the name of the argument for \
  which you wish to specify a default value.  It may either be the argument \
  name on its own (which will be used for any tool that offers that \
  argument), or it may consist of the tool name, a period, and the argument \
  name (which will only be used for the specified tool).  For example, a \
  property name of ''toolName.argName'' will only be used to specify the \
  value for the argName argument for the toolName tool, while a property name \
  of ''argName'' will be used to specify the value for any tool that supports \
  the argName argument.  Similarly, if the tool supports subcommands, then \
  the property name may consist of the tool name, a period, the subcommand \
  name, a period, and the argument name (e.g., \
  ''toolName.subCommandName.argName''), and the property will only be used \
  in conjunction with the specified subcommand.  A property that includes a \
  subcommand name will take precedence over a property that does not include \
  a subcommand name, and a property that includes a tool name will take \
  precedence over a property that does not include a tool name.
INFO_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_HEADER_4=If an argument supports multiple values, then \
  the same property may appear multiple times with each of the desired \
  default values.  The values will be used in the order that they appear in \
  the properties file.
INFO_PARSER_GEN_PROPS_HEADER_5=The following properties are supported for use \
  with the ''{0}'' tool:
INFO_PARSER_PROMPT_FOR_PROP_FILE_ENC_PW=Properties file ''{0}'' is encrypted.  \
  Please enter the passphrase used to encrypt it:
ERR_PARSER_WRONG_PROP_FILE_ENC_PW=The provided encryption passphrase is \

  definition at or near line {1} with a malformed Unicode escape sequence \
  that starts with a backslash followed by a letter u but that is not then \
