  some key store types, but may be required for others.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for the \
  key store.  This is usually not necessary when exporting certificates, but \
  it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing the \
  certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS mode).  The \
  value must be one of ''JKS'' (for the Java Key Store format), ''PKCS12'' \
  (for the standard PKCS #12 format), or ''BCFKS'' (for the Bouncy Castle \
  FIPS 140-2-compliant key store type).  If this is not provided, then an \
  attempt will be made to automatically infer the correct key store type.

  its issuer chain) should be exported rather than just the specified target \
  certificate.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_CERT_ARG_FORMAT_DESC=The output format to use for \
  the exported certificate.  The value may be either ''PEM'' (to export the \
  certificate in the text-based PEM format), or ''DER'' (to export the \

  PEM output format will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_CERT_ARG_FILE_DESC=The path to the output file \
  to which the exported certificate should be written.  An output file is \
  optional when using the PEM format, but required when using the DER \
  format.  If no output file is provided, then the exported certificate will \
  be written to standard output.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_CERT_ARG_SEPARATE_FILE_DESC=Indicates that if \
  multiple certificates are to be exported, then each certificate should be \
  written to a different file rather than concatenating all of them into the \
  same file.  This can only be used if both the --export-certificate-chain \
  and --output-file arguments are also provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_CERT_ARG_DISPLAY_COMMAND_DESC=Display a command \
  that can be invoked to achieve a similar result with the Java keytool \

  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password needed to access the contents of the key store.  A \
  key store password is required when exporting a private key, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a key store \
  password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one \
  line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text key store password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the key store password.  A key store password is required when \
  exporting a private key, so one of the --keystore-password, \

  be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PK_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) used to protect the private key.  In many cases, the \
  private key password will be the same as the password used to protect the \
  key store itself, and in such instances, the private key password can be \
  omitted and the key store password will be used.  However, if a private key \

INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for the \
  key store.  This is usually not necessary when exporting private keys, but \
  it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing the \
  certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS mode).  The \
  value must be one of ''JKS'' (for the Java Key Store format), ''PKCS12'' \
  (for the standard PKCS #12 format), or ''BCFKS'' (for the Bouncy Castle \
  FIPS 140-2-compliant key store type).  If this is not provided, then an \
  attempt will be made to automatically infer the correct key store type.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) of the private key to export.  This is required, and it may only \
  be provided once.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_FORMAT_DESC=The output format to use for \
  the exported private key.  The value may be either ''PEM'' (to export the \
  private key in the text-based PEM format), or ''DER'' (to export the key in \
  the binary DER format).  If this is not provided, then the PEM output \
  format will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_FILE_DESC=The path to the output file to \
  which the exported private key should be written.  An output file is \
  optional when using the PEM format, but required when using the DER \
  format.  If no output file is provided, then the exported private key will \
  be written to standard output.

  chain, and optionally a private key, into a key store.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_DESC=The path to the key store file \
  into which the certificates and key should be imported.  This is required, \
  but if the file does not exist, then it will be created.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  If the \
  key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A \
  key store password is required when importing certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password \
  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The password (also \
  called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the \
  key store.  If the key store does not exist, then it will be created with \
  this password.  A key store password is required when importing \
  certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, \
  or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a key \
  store password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain \
  only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text key store \
  password.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the key store password.  If the key store does not exist, then \
  it will be created with this password.  A key store password is required \
  when importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for the \
  key store to create.  This argument should only be provided when creating a \
  new key store, and it will be ignored if the key store already exists.  The \
  value must be either ''JKS'' for the non-standard Java Key Store format, or \
  ''PKCS12'' for the standard PKCS #12 format.  If this is not provided, then \
  a default key store type of ''JKS'' will be used for newly-created key \
  stores.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) to use for the imported certificate.  If multiple certificates \
  are to be imported, then the behavior depends on whether a private key will \
  also be imported.  When importing a certificate chain along with a private \
  key, then the alias must not already exist in the key store, and the \
  private key and the entire certificate chain will be stored under this \
  alias.  When importing a certificate for which the corresponding private \
  key already exists in the key store (for example, if you used the \
  generate-certificate-request subcommand to create a certificate signing \
  request and are now importing the signed certificate), then you should use \
  the same alias that is used for the existing private key, and you should \
  provide the complete certificate chain.  When importing a certificate \
  for which the corresponding private key does not already exist in the \
  key store and for which the private key is not being provided by the \
  --private-key-file argument, then the alias must not already exist in the \
  key store, and any provided issuer certificates (which you should provide \
  if they do not already exist in the key store and are not in the JVM''s \
  default set of trusted issuer certificates) will be imported with aliases \
  that are generated from the provided alias.  If there is only one issuer \
  certificate to be imported, then it will be stored with an alias that is \
  the provided alias with ''-issuer'' appended onto it.  If there are \
  multiple issuer certificates to be imported, then their aliases will be the \
  provided alias with ''-issuer-#'' appended onto it, where ''#'' will be \
  ''1'' for the first issuer certificate, ''2'' for the second, and so on.  \
  This is a required argument.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_CERT_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing a certificate or certificate chain to import.  The certificates \
  in the file may be stored either in the text-based PEM or the binary DER \
  format, but if the file contains multiple certificates, then they must all \
  be in the same format.  You may also provide this argument multiple times \
  to specify multiple files containing certificates to import.  However, if \
  multiple certificates are provided, then they must all form a certificate \
  chain in which each subsequent certificate is the issuer certificate for \
  the previous certificate.  When importing a non-self-signed certificate, \
  you should ensure that its issuer certificate is also being imported, is \
  already in the key store under a different alias, or is in the JVM''s \
  default set of trusted certificates.  At least one certificate file is \
  required.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KEY_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the private key for the end certificate in the chain to be \
  imported.  It may be stored in either the text-based PEM or the binary \
  DER format.  This is an optional argument, and at most one private key file \
  may be specified, and that file may contain only a single private key.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PK_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) to use to protect the private key.  This is only needed \
  when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the key store password will be used as the private key password.  However, \
  if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a password \
  that does not match the key store password, or if you are importing a new \
  certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password that \
  does not match the key store password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PK_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only \
  needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the key store password will be used as the private key password.  \
  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a \
  password that does not match the key store password, or if you are importing \
  a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password \
  that does not match the key store password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.  If a \
  private key password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must \
  contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text \
  private key password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_PK_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only \
  needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the key store password will be used as the private key password.  \
  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a \
  password that does not match the key store password, or if you are \
  importing a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a \
  password that does not match the key store password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_NO_PROMPT_DESC=Import the certificates \
  without prompting the end user.  By default, the certificates will be \
  displayed and the user will be interactively prompted about whether to \
  import them.

  be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DELETE_CERT_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for the \
  key store.  This is usually not necessary when deleting certificates, but \
  it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing the \
  certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS mode).  The \
  value must be one of ''JKS'' (for the Java Key Store format), ''PKCS12'' \
  (for the standard PKCS #12 format), or ''BCFKS'' (for the Bouncy Castle \

  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  If the \
  key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A \
  key store password is required when generating certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \

  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The password (also called a \

  stores.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) to use for the newly-generated certificate.  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then this must be the \

  the self-signed certificate.  If the --replace-existing-certificate \
  argument is not provided, then the alias must not already exist in the \
  key store.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_REPLACE_DESC=Indicates that the new \
  self-signed certificate should replace the certificate chain associated \
  with an existing private key that is identified by the --alias argument, \
  reusing the existing key pair.  If this argument is not provided, then a \

INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SUBJECT_DN_DESC=The subject DN for the new \
  certificate.  This must be provided unless then \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is given.  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then the --subject-dn \
  argument may be omitted if you want to reuse the same subject as the \
  existing certificate.  A subject DN typically includes at least a ''CN'' \
  attribute (which in a server certificate should be the hostname that \
  clients are expected to use when connecting to the server, and in other \

  not be provided if the --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  If \
  neither this argument nor the --replace-existing-certificate argument is \
  provided, then a default key algorithm of ''RSA'' will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KEY_SIZE_BITS_DESC=The size of the key to \
  generate, in bits.  This argument must not be provided if the \

INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SIG_ALG_DESC=The name of the algorithm to \
  use to sign the certificate.  This argument must not be provided if the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  This argument must be \
  provided if the --key-algorithm argument is used to specify an algorithm \
  other than ''RSA''.  If neither this argument nor the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then a default \
  signature algorithm of ''SHA256withRSA'' will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_INHERIT_EXT_DESC=This argument can only be \
  used in conjunction with the --replace-existing-certificate argument, and \
  it indicates that the new certificate should inherit all of the same \
  extension values as the certificate being replaced (although extensions \
  known to apply to the certificate''s issuer, like authority key identifier \
  and issuer alternative name, may be excluded).  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided without the \
  --inherit-extensions argument, then the new certificate will only have the \
  extensions that are explicitly specified using other arguments.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_DNS_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified DNS \
  hostname.  This can be used to help clients trust a server certificate if \
  they connect to the server using a different hostname than is included in \

  multiple times to specify multiple alternate hostnames, and hostnames can \
  have an asterisk as their leftmost component (for example, \
  ''*.example.com'' or ''*.east.example.com'') to match any value in that \
  component.  Each value must contain only ASCII characters, so \
  internationalized domain names must use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) \
  described in RFC 5890.

  must use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) described in RFC 5890.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_URI_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified URI \
  value.  This can be provided multiple times to specify multiple URIs.  Each \

  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be used to provide that \
  private key password.  If none of these arguments is given, then the \

  certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS mode).  The \
  value must be one of ''JKS'' (for the Java Key Store format), ''PKCS12'' \
  (for the standard PKCS #12 format), or ''BCFKS'' (for the Bouncy Castle \
  FIPS 140-2-compliant key store type).  If this is not provided, then an \
  attempt will be made to automatically infer the correct key store type.

  attribute (which in a server certificate should be the hostname that \
  clients are expected to use when connecting to the server, and in other \
  certificates indicates the purpose of that certificate), and may also \
  include additional attributes like ''OU'' (the associated department or \
  organizational unit name), ''O'' (the company or organization name), ''L'' \
  (the city or locality name), ''ST'' (the full name -- NOT the two-letter \
  abbreviation -- of the state or province), ''C'' (the two-letter country \
  code -- NOT the full country name).  For example:  \
  ''CN=ldap.example.com,OU=Directory Services,O=Example \
  Corporation,L=Austin,ST=Texas,C=US''.  This argument is optional, and if it \

  hostname than is included in the CN attribute of the certificate subject.  \
  This can be provided multiple times to specify multiple alternate \
  hostnames, and hostnames can have an asterisk as their leftmost component \
  (for example, ''*.example.com'' or ''*.east.example.com'') to match any \

  verbose information about the peer certificate (ignoring any issuer \
  certificates), and write a PEM representation of that certificate to the \
  ''ds-cert.pem'' file.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_DESC=Initiates a secure connection to a \
  server to get that server''s certificate chain, and then adds those \
  certificates to a key store so that it can be used as a trust store for that \
  server.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_HOSTNAME_DESC=The hostname or IP \
  address of the server to which the connection should be established.  This \
  must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_PORT_DESC=The TCP port number of the \
  server to which the connection should be established.  Unless the \
  --use-ldap-start-tls argument is provided, the port number must be one on \
  which the server expects to accept TLS-based connections.  If the \
  --use-ldap-start-tls argument is provided, then the specified port must be \
  one on which an LDAP server is listening for non-secure connections but \
  on which clients may use the StartTLS extended operation to transition to \
  using secure communication.  Standard secure port numbers include 636 for \
  LDAPS and 443 for HTTPS, and the standard non-secure port for LDAP is 389.  \
  This must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_USE_START_TLS_DESC=Indicates that the \
  tool should initially establish a non-secure connection to an LDAP server, \
  and then use the StartTLS extended operation to transition to using secure \
  communication.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_KS_DESC=The path to the key store file \
  to which the certificates should be added.  This is required, but if the \
  file does not exist, then it will be created.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  If the \
  key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A \
  key store password is required when importing certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password \
  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The password (also \
  called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key \
  store.  If the key store does not exist, then it will be created with this \
  password.  A key store password is required when importing certificates, so \
  one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a key store \
  password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one \
  line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text key store \
  password.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the key store password.  If the key store does not exist, then \
  it will be created with this password.  A key store password is required \
  when importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for the \
  key store to create.  This argument should only be provided when creating a \
  new key store, and it will be ignored if the key store already exists.  The \
  value must be either ''JKS'' for the non-standard Java Key Store format, or \
  ''PKCS12'' for the standard PKCS #12 format.  If this is not provided, then \
  a default key store type of ''JKS'' will be used for newly-created key \
  stores.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) to use for the first certificate to add to the key store.  This \
  alias must not already be in use in the key store.  If multiple \
  certificates are to be imported, then the first certificate imported will \
  use this alias, and subsequent certificates will have either ''-issuer'' \
  (if there is only one issuer certificate) or ''-issuer-#'' (if there are \
  multiple issuers, where # will be replaced with an incrementing number for \
  each subsequent issuer).  If this is omitted, then a default alias will be \
  constructed from the hostname and port number.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_ISSUERS_ONLY_DESC=Indicates that the \
  tool should only update the key store to include the issuer certificates \
  for the target server, but omit the server certificate at the head of the \
  chain.  This may be useful in environments in which all servers are signed \
  by a common issuer and it is sufficient to trust just the issuer \
  certificates.  This argument will not have any effect for self-signed \
  certificates in which a certificate is its own issuer.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_NO_PROMPT_DESC=Trust the server \
  certificates without prompting the end user.  By default, the server \
  certificate chain will be displayed and the user will be interactively \
  prompted about whether to trust the certificate.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_ENABLE_SSL_DEBUGGING_DESC=Enable \
  Java''s low-level support for debugging SSL/TLS communication.  This is \
  equivalent to setting the ''javax.net.debug'' property to ''all''.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_ARG_VERBOSE_DESC=Display verbose \
  information about the certificates in the server''s certificate chain.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_EXAMPLE_1=Establishes a secure connection \
  to the server ds.example.com on port 636 and adds that server''s \
  certificate chain to the ''{0}'' key store with a base alias of \
  ''ds.example.com:636''.  The tool will display verbose information about \
  the certificate chain presented by the server, and will interactively \
  prompt about whether to trust that chain.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_TRUST_SERVER_EXAMPLE_2=Establishes a non-secure \
  connection to ds.example.com on port 389, and then uses the LDAP StartTLS \
  extended operation to transition to a secure connection.  It will then add \
  the server''s issuer certificates to the ''{0}'' key store with a base \
  alias of ''ds-start-tls-cert''.  The tool will trust the certificate chain \
  without any confirmation from the user.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_DESC=Examines a key store to determine \
  how suitable a specified certificate is for use as a server certificate.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_KS_DESC=The path to the key store \
  file containing the certificate to check.  This is required, and the \
  key store file must exist.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called \
  a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  A \
  key store password is required, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password needed to access the contents of the key store.  A \
  key store password is required, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.  If a key store password file is supplied, then the file must \
  exist, must contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the \
  clear-text key store password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the key store password.  A key store password is required, so \
  one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The key store type for \
  the key store.  This is usually not necessary when checking certificate \
  usability, but it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing \
  the certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS mode).  \
  The value must be one of ''JKS'' (for the Java Key Store format), \
  ''PKCS12'' (for the standard PKCS #12 format), or ''BCFKS'' (for the Bouncy \
  Castle FIPS 140-2-compliant key store type).  If this is not provided, then \
  an attempt will be made to automatically infer the correct key store type.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) of the certificate to examine.  This is required, and it may only \
  be provided once.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_IGNORE_SHA1_WARNING_DESC=Do not fail the \
  validation check merely because an issuer certificate contains a signature \
  based on the SHA-1 digest algorithm.  The SHA-1 algorithm is considered \
  weak, and some clients may reject a certificate chain that includes a \
  certificate with a SHA-1-based signature, but because some commercial \
  authorities still use SHA-1-based root certificates, this argument makes it \
  possible to ignore this warning for issuer certificates.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_CHECK_USABILITY_EXAMPLE_1=Check the ''server-cert'' \
  certificate in the ''{0}'' key store to determine how suitable it is for \
  use as a server certificate.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_DESC=Displays information about all of the \
  certificates contained in a file.  The certificates may be formatted in \
  either the text-based PEM or the binary DER format, and if the file \
  multiple certificates, then all certificates must use the same format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_ARG_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the certificates to be printed.  The certificates may be \
  formatted in either the text-based PEM format or the binary DER format.  \
  If the certificates are in PEM format, then each certificate must include \
  the begin header and end footer, and blank lines and lines that start with \
  the octothorpe character (#) will be ignored.  If the certificates are in \
  DER format, then there must not be any delimiter between the certificates.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_ARG_VERBOSE_DESC=Display verbose \
  information about each of the certificates.  If this argument is not \
  provided, then the listing will only include basic summary information for \
  each certificate, including its subject and issuer DNs, validity start and \
  end times, and fingerprints.  If this argument is provided, then additional \
  information, including the X.509 certificate version, serial number, \
  signature algorithm and value, public key algorithm and content, and \
  extensions, will also be included.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_ARG_DISPLAY_COMMAND_DESC=Display a command \
  that can be invoked to achieve a similar result with the Java keytool \
  utility.  Note that this may just be an approximation, since the \
  manage-certificates and keytool utilities do not provide exactly the same \
  sets of functionality.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_EXAMPLE_1=Display basic information about \
  each of the certificates in file ''{0}''.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CERT_EXAMPLE_2=Display verbose information about \
  each of the certificates in file ''{0}''.  It will also display a command \
  that can be used to accomplish a similar result using the Java keytool \
  utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CSR_DESC=Displays information about a \
  certificate signing request (CSR) contained in a file.  The CSR may be \
  formatted in either the text-based PEM or the binary DER format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CSR_ARG_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the certificate signing request (CSR) to be printed.  The CSR \
  may be formatted in either the text-based PEM format or the binary DER \
  format.  If the request is in PEM format, it must include the begin header \
  and end footer, and blank lines and lines that start with the \
  octothorpe character (#) will be ignored.  The file must contain only a \
  single certificate signing request.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CSR_ARG_VERBOSE_DESC=Display verbose information \
  about the certificate signing request.  If this argument is not provided, \
  then the listing will only include basic summary information for the \
  request, including its subject DN, signature algorithm, and public key \
  algorithm.  If this argument is provided, then additional information about \
  the signature, public key, and extensions will be included.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CSR_ARG_DISPLAY_COMMAND_DESC=Display a command \
  that can be invoked to achieve a similar result with the Java keytool \
  utility.  Note that this may just be an approximation, since the \
  manage-certificates and keytool utilities do not provide exactly the same \
  sets of functionality.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DISPLAY_CSR_EXAMPLE_1=Display information about the \
