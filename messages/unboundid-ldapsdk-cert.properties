  containing the private key to export.  This is required, and the keystore \
  file must exist.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the keystore.  A \
  keystore password is required when exporting a private key, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password needed to access the contents of the keystore.  A \
  keystore password is required when exporting a private key, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a keystore \
  password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one \
  line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text keystore password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the keystore password.  A keystore password is required when \
  exporting a private key, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PK_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) used to protect the private key.  In many cases, the \
  private key password will be the same as the password used to protect the \
  keystore itself, and in such instances, the private key password can be \
  omitted and the keystore password will be used.  However, if a private key \
  is protected with a different password than the keystore itself, then one \
  of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PK_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password used to protect the private key.  In many cases, \
  the private key password will be the same as the password used to protect \
  the keystore itself, and in such instances, the private key password can be \
  omitted and the keystore password will be used.  However, if a private key \
  is protected with a different password than the keystore itself, then one \
  of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments must be provided.  If a private \
  key password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only \
  one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text private key \
  password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_PK_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the private key password.  In many cases, the private key \
  password will be the same as the password used to protect the keystore \
  itself, and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the keystore password will be used.  However, if a private key is protected \
  with a different password than the keystore itself, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) of the private key to export.  This is required, and it may only \
  be provided once.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_FORMAT_DESC=The output format to use for \
  the exported private key.  The value may be either 'PEM' (to export the \
  private key in the text-based PEM format), or 'DER' (to export the key in \
  the binary DER format).  If this is not provided, then the PEM output \
  format will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_ARG_FILE_DESC=The path to the output file to \
  which the exported private key should be written.  An output file is \
  optional when using the PEM format, but required when using the DER \
  format.  If no output file is provided, then the exported private key will \
  be written to standard output.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_EXAMPLE_1=Export the private key for the \
  'server-cert' certificate to standard output in PEM format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_EXPORT_KEY_EXAMPLE_2=Export the private key for the \
  'server-cert' certificate to the specified output file in the binary DER \
  format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_DESC=Imports a certificate or certificate \
  chain, and optionally a private key, into a keystore.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_DESC=The path to the keystore file \
  into which the certificates and key should be imported.  This is required, \
  but if the file does not exist, then it will be created.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the keystore.  If the \
  keystore does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A \
  keystore password is required when importing certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password \
  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The password (also \
  called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the keystore.  \
  If the keystore does not exist, then it will be created with this \
  password.  A keystore password is required when importing certificates, so \
  one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a keystore \
  password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one \
  line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text keystore password.  \
  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the keystore password.  If the keystore does not exist, then it \
  will be created with this password.  A keystore password is required when \
  importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, \
  --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must \
  be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The keystore type for the \
  keystore to create.  This argument should only be provided when creating a \
  new keystore, and it will be ignored if the keystore already exists.  The \
  value must be either 'JKS' for the non-standard Java KeyStore format, or \
  'PKCS12' for the standard PKCS#12 format.  If this is not provided, then a \
  default keystore type of 'PKCS12' will be used for newly-created keystores.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) to use for the imported certificate.  If multiple certificates \
  are to be imported, then the behavior depends on whether a private key will \
  also be imported.  When importing a certificate chain along with a private \
  key, then the alias must not already exist in the keystore, and the private \
  key and the entire certificate chain will be stored under this alias.  When \
  importing a certificate for which the corresponding private key already \
  exists in the keystore (for example, if you used the \
  generate-certificate-request subcommand to create a certificate signing \
  request and are now importing the signed certificate), then you should use \
  the same alias that is used for the existing private key, and you should \
  provide the complete certificate chain.  When importing a certificate \
  for which the corresponding private key does not already exist in the \
  keystore and for which the private key is not being provided by the \
  --private-key-file argument, then the alias must not already exist in the \
  keystore, and any provided issuer certificates (which you should provide \
  if they do not already exist in the keystore and are not in the JVM's \
  default set of trusted issuer certificates) will be imported with aliases \
  that are generated from the provided alias.  If there is only one issuer \
  certificate to be imported, then it will be stored with an alias that is \
  the provided alias with '-issuer' appended onto it.  If there are multiple \
  issuer certificates to be imported, then their aliases will be the provided \
  alias with '-issuer-#' appended onto it, where '#' will be '1' for the \
  first issuer certificate, '2' for the second, and so on.  This is a \
  required argument.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_CERT_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing a certificate or certificate chain to import.  The certificates \
  in the file may be stored either in the text-based PEM or the binary DER \
  format, but if the file contains multiple certificates, then they must all \
  be in the same format.  You may also provide this argument multiple times \
  to specify multiple files containing certificates to import.  However, if \
  multiple certificates are provided, then they must all form a certificate \
  chain in which each subsequent certificate is the issuer certificate for \
  the previous certificate.  When importing a non-self-signed certificate, \
  you should ensure that its issuer certificate is also being imported, is \
  already in the keystore under a different alias, or is in the JVM's default \
  set of trusted certificates.  At least one certificate file is required.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_KEY_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the private key for the end certificate in the chain to be \
  imported.  It may be stored in either the text-based PEM or the binary \
  DER format.  This is an optional argument, and at most one private key file \
  may be specified, and that file may contain only a single private key.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PK_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) to use to protect the private key.  This is only needed \
  when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the keystore \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the the keystore password will be used as the private key password.  \
  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a \
  password that does not match the keystore password, or if you are importing \
  a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password \
  that does not match the keystore password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PK_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only \
  needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the keystore \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the the keystore password will be used as the private key password.  \
  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a \
  password that does not match the keystore password, or if you are importing \
  a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password \
  that does not match the keystore password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.  If a \
  private key password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must \
  contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text \
  private key password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_PK_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only \
  needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when \
  importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  \
  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the keystore \
  password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and \
  the the keystore password will be used as the private key password.  \
  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a \
  password that does not match the keystore password, or if you are importing \
  a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password \
  that does not match the keystore password, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_NO_PROMPT_DESC=Import the certificates \
  without prompting the end user.  By default, the certificates will be \
  displayed and the user will be interactively prompted about whether to \
  import them.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_IMPORT_CERT_ARG_DISPLAY_COMMAND_DESC=Display a command \
  that can be invoked to achieve a similar result with the Java keytool \
  utility.  Note that this may just be an approximation, since the \
  manage-certificates and keytool utilities do not provide exactly the same \
  sets of functionality.

INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DELETE_CERT_ARG_KS_DESC=The path to the keystore file \
  containing the certificate to remove.  This is required, and the keystore \
  file must exist.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DELETE_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the keystore.  A \
  keystore password is required when importing certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DELETE_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The path to a file \
  containing the password needed to access the contents of the keystore.  A \
  keystore password is required when importing certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a keystore \

  line, and that line must consist only of the \
  clear-text keystore password.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_DELETE_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the keystore password.  A keystore password is required when \
  importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, \

  but if the file does not exist, then it will be created.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the keystore.  If the \
  keystore does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A \
  keystore password is required when generating certificates, so one of the \
  --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password \
  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KS_PW_FILE_DESC=The password (also called a \

  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_PROMPT_FOR_KS_PW_DESC=Interactively \
  prompt for the keystore password.  If the keystore does not exist, then it \
  will be created with this password.  A keystore password is required when \

  be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_PK_PW_DESC=The password (also called a \
  passphrase or PIN) to use to protect the private key.  Although in many \
  cases, private keys will be protected with the same password as the \
  keystore itself, it is possible to use a different password for the private \
  key.  If an alternate private key password is needed, then one of the \
  --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or \
  --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be used to provide that \
  private key password.  If none of these arguments is given, then the \

  for the password to use to protect the private key.  Although in many \
  cases, private keys will be protected with the same password as the \
  keystore itself, it is possible to use a different password for the private \
  key.  If an alternate private key password is needed, then one of the \

  private key password.  If none of these arguments is given, then the \
  keystore password will be used as the private key password.  The password \
  must contain at least six characters.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KS_TYPE_DESC=The keystore type for the \
  keystore to create.  This argument should only be provided when creating a \
  new keystore, and it will be ignored if the keystore already exists.  The \
  value must be either 'JKS' for the non-standard Java KeyStore format, or \
  'PKCS12' for the standard PKCS#12 format.  If this is not provided, then a \
  default keystore type of 'PKCS12' will be used for newly-created keystores.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_ALIAS_DESC=The alias (also called a \
  nickname) to use for the newly-generated certificate.  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then this must be the \
  alias of the private key for which to replace the certificate chain with \
  the self-signed certificate.  If the --replace-existing-certificate \
  argument is not provided, then the alias must not already exist in the \
  keystore.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_REPLACE_DESC=Indicates that the new \
  self-signed certificate should replace the certificate chain associated \
  with an existing private key that is identified by the --alias argument, \
  reusing the existing keypair.  If this argument is not provided, then a \
  new keypair will be generated.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SUBJECT_DN_DESC=The subject DN for the new \
  certificate.  This must be provided unless then \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is given.  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then the --subject-dn \
  argument may be omitted if you want to reuse the same subject as the \
  existing certificate.  A subject DN typically includes at least a 'CN' \
  attribute (which in a server certificate should be the hostname that \
  clients are expected to use when connecting to the server, and in other \
  certificates indicates the purpose of that certificate), and may also \
  include additional attributes like 'OU' (the associated department name), \
  'O' (the company or organization name), 'L' (the city or locality name), \
  'ST' (the full name -- NOT the two-letter abbreviation -- of the state or \
  province), 'C' (the two-letter country code -- NOT the full country name).  \
  For example:  'CN=ldap.example.com,OU=Directory Services,O=Example \
  Corporation,L=Austin,ST=Texas,C=US'.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_DAYS_VALID_DESC=The number of days that \

  provided, then a default value of 365 days will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_VALIDITY_START_TIME_DESC=The time that the \
  certificate's validity window should start (that is, the 'notBefore' \
  value).  If this is not provided, then the current time will be used.  If a \
  value is given, it should be in the form 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss' (for example, \
  ''{0}'').  Timestamp values are assumed to be in the local time zone.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KEY_ALGORITHM_DESC=The name of the key \
  algorithm to use to generate the keypair.  If present, the value will \
  typically be 'RSA' or 'EC' (for elliptic curve).  This argument must not be \
  provided if the --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  If \
  neither this argument nor the --replace-existing-certificate argument is \
  provided, then a default key algorithm of 'RSA' will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KEY_SIZE_BITS_DESC=The size of the key to \
  generate, in bits.  This argument must not be provided if the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  This argument must be \
  provided if the --key-algorithm argument is used to specify an algorithm \
  other than 'RSA'.  If neither this argument nor the \

  size of 2048 bits will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SIG_ALG_DESC=The name of the algorithm to \
  use to sign the certificate.  This argument must not be provided if the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  This argument must be \
  provided if the --key-algorithm argument is used to specify an algorithm \
  other than 'RSA'.  If neither this argument nor the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then a default \
  signature algorithm of 'SHA256withRSA' will be used.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_INHERIT_EXT_DESC=This argument can only be \
  used in conjunction with the --replace-existing-certificate argument, and \
  it indicates that the new certificate should inherit all of the same \
  extension values as the certificate being replaced (although extensions \
  known to apply to the certificate's issuer, like authority key identifier \
  and issuer alternative name, may be excluded).  If the \
  --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided without the \
  --inherit-extensions argument, then the new certificate will only have the \
  extensions that are explicitly specified using other arguments.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_DNS_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified DNS \
  hostname.  This can be used to help clients trust a server certificate if \
  they connect to the server using a different hostname than is included in \
  the CN attribute of the certificate subject.  This can be provided \
  multiple times to specify multiple alternate hostnames, and hostnames can \
  have an asterisk as their leftmost component (for example, '*.example.com' \
  or '*.east.example.com') to match any value in that component.  Each value \
  must contain only ASCII characters, so internationalized domain names must \
  use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) described in RFC 5890.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_IP_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified IP \
  address.  This can be used to help clients trust a server certificate if \
  they connect to the server using an IP address rather than the hostname \
  that is included in the CN attribute of the certificate subject.  This can \
  be provided multiple times to specify multiple IP addresses, and each value \
  must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.  There is no support for wildcards, \
  CIDR, other mechanisms for specifying a range of addresses.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_EMAIL_DESC=Indicates that the \
  certificate should include a subject alternative name extension with the \
  specified email address (technically, RFC 822 name) value.  This can be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple email addresses.  Each value \
  must contain only ASCII characters, so internationalized email addresses \
  must use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) described in RFC 5890.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_URI_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified URI \
  value.  This can be provided multiple times to specify multiple URIs.  Each \
  value must contain only ASCII characters, so internationalized resource \
  identifiers must be mapped to URIs as described in RFC 3987.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_SAN_OID_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a subject alternative name extension with the specified OID \
  as a resource identifier.  This can be provided multiple times to specify \
  multiple OIDs, and each value must be the string representation of a valid \
  object identifier.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_BC_IS_CA_DESC=Indicates that the \
  certificate should include a basic constraints extension that indicates \
  whether the certificate should be considered a certification authority.  If \
  present, the value must be either 'true' or 'false'.

  certificate should include a basic constraints extension that specifies the \
  maximum allowed length (in number of certificates) of a certificate chain \
  that includes this certification authority certificate.  This argument can \
  only be provided in conjunction with a --basic-constraints-is-ca value of \
  'true'.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CERT_ARG_KU_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  should include a key usage extension that indicates that the certificate \

  This can be provided multiple times to specify multiple alternate \
  hostnames, and hostnames can have an asterisk as their leftmost component \
  (for example, '*.example.com' or '*.east.example.com') to match any value \
  in that component.  Each value must contain only ASCII characters, so \
  internationalized domain names must use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding \
  (ACE) described in RFC 5890.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_SC_GEN_CSR_ARG_SAN_IP_DESC=Indicates that the certificate \
  signing request should include a subject alternative name extension with \

  used to obtain a similar result with the Java keytool utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_EXPORT_CERT_1=Exports a PEM-formatted \
  representation of the certificate contained in the 'server-cert' alias in \
  the ''{0}'' keystore and writes it to the ''{1}'' output file.  Also, \
  display a command that can be used to obtain a similar result with the Java \
  keytool utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_EXPORT_KEY_1=Exports a PEM-formatted representation \
  of the private key contained in the 'server-cert' alias in the ''{0}'' \
  keystore and writes it to the ''{1}'' output file.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_IMPORT_1=Imports a certificate chain read from file \
  ''{0}'' and the corresponding private key read from file ''{1}'' into the \
  ''server-cert'' alias in the ''{2}'' keystore.  If the keystore does not \
  already exist, then it will be created using the standard PKCS#12 format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_DELETE_1=Deletes the certificate stored in the \
  'server-cert' alias in the ''{0}'' keystore.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_GEN_CERT_1=Generates a self-signed certificate with \
  alias 'ca-cert' in the ''{0}'' keystore.  If the keystore does not already \
  exist, then it will be created using the standard PKCS#12 format.  The \
  certificate will have a subject DN of 'CN=Example Authority,O=Example \
  Corporation,C=US', a 4096-bit RSA key, and a signature generated using the \
  SHA256withRSA algorithm.  The certificate will be valid for 7300 days \
  starting at midnight local time on January 1, 2017.  It will include a \
  basic constraints extension that indicates the certificate can act as a \
  certification authority, and a key usage extension that indicates that the \
  key can be used for signing certificates and CRLs.  Also, display a command \
  that can be used to obtain a similar result with the Java keytool utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_GEN_CSR_1=Generates a certificate signing request \
  for a new certificate with subject 'CN=ldap.example.com,O=Example \
  Corporation,C=US' that will be stored in the 'server-cert' alias in the \
  ''{0}'' keystore.  A new 256-bit elliptic curve keypair will be created, \
  the request will be signed with the SHA256withECDSA signature algorithm, \
  and the request will include a subject alternative name extension with \
  alternate DNS names of 'ldap1.example.com' and 'ldap2.example.com', and an \
  extended key usage extension to indicate that the certificate should be \
  usable for either TLS server authentication or TLS client authentication.  \
  The certificate signing request will be written in PEM format to output \
  file ''{1}''.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_GEN_CSR_2=Generates a certificate signing request \
  intended to renew the existing certificate stored in alias 'server-cert' in \
  the ''{0}'' keystore.  The request will use the same subject DN and set of \
  extensions as the certificate currently stored in that alias, and it will \
  be written to standard output in PEM format.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_SIGN_CERT_1=Uses the 'ca-cert' certificate in \
  keystore ''{0}'' to sign the certificate signing request (CSR) contained in \
  file ''{1}'' and writes the signed certificate to PEM-formatted output file \
  ''{2}''.  The signed certificate will use the subject DN and set of \
  extensions included in the request, and the resulting certificate will be \
  valid for 730 days, starting immediately.  Also, display a command that can \
  be used to obtain a similar result with the Java keytool utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_CHANGE_ALIAS_1=Updates the ''{0}'' keystore to \
  change the alias of the 'server-cert' certificate to be \
  'server-certificate'.  Also, display a command that can be used to obtain a \
  similar result with the Java keytool utility.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_TRUST_SERVER_1=Connects to the ldap.example.com \
  server on port 636 to retrieve the certificate chain that the server \
  presents during TLS negotiation.  That certificate chain will be added to \
  the ''{0}'' keystore with a base alias of 'ldap.example.com:636' after \
  interactively confirming that the certificate chain should be trusted.
INFO_MANAGE_CERTS_EXAMPLE_CHECK_USABILITY_1=Examines the 'server-cert' \
  certificate in the ''{0}'' keystore to determine whether that certificate \
  is suitable for use as a TLS server certificate.
