INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_1=Compare the contents of two files \
  containing LDIF entries.  The output will be an LDIF file containing the \
  add, delete, and modify change records needed to convert the data in the \
  source LDIF file into the data in the target LDIF file.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=This tool works best with small LDIF files \
  because it reads the entire contents of the source and target LDIF files \
  into memory so they can be quickly compared.  If you encounter an out of \
  memory error while running the tool, you may need to increase the amount of \
  memory available to the JVM used to invoke it.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=The amount of memory available to the JVM \
  may be customized by invoking the JVM with the ''-Xms'' and ''-Xmx'' \
  arguments (which specify the initial and maximum amounts of memory that it \
  may use, respectively).  These arguments should be immediately followed \
  (without any intervening space) by an integer and a unit to specify the \
  amount of memory that may be used.  The unit may be either ''m'' to \
  indicate that the size is in megabytes, or ''g'' to indicate that it is in \
  gigabytes.  For example, ''-Xms512m'' indicates that the JVM should be \
  given an initial heap size of 512 megabytes, while ''-Xmx2g'' indicates \
  that it should be given a maximum heap size of two gigabytes.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4_STANDALONE=When invoking the {0} tool \
  with the shell script or batch file included as part of the LDAP SDK, you \
  may use the ''JAVA_ARGS'' environment variable to specify the arguments to \
  use when invoking the JVM.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4_PING_SERVER=When invoking the {0} tool \
  included in the installation of a Ping Identity server product, you may \
  edit the config/java.properties file to specify the arguments to use when \
  invoking the JVM.  After modifying the file, run the dsjavaproperties tool \
  to ensure that those changes will be used for subsequent tool invocations.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_SOURCE=Source LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_LDIF=The path to the LDIF file containing \
  the entries to use as the source data set.  This argument must be \
  specified, and the source LDIF file must exist.  The LDIF file may \
  optionally be gzip-compressed and/or passphrase-encrypted.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the \
  tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, and if the \
  file was not encrypted with a key from the server''s encryption settings \
  database, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_TARGET=Target LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_LDIF=The path to the LDIF file containing \
  the entries to use as the target data set.  This argument must be \
  specified, and the target LDIF file must exist.  The LDIF file may \
  optionally be gzip-compressed and/or passphrase-encrypted.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the target LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  target LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the \
  tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the target LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  target LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, and if the \
  file was not encrypted with a key from the server''s encryption settings \
  database, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_OUTPUT=Output LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_LDIF=The path to the LDIF file to which the \
  resulting LDIF add, delete, and modify change records will be written.  If \
  this file already exists, then the new LDIF records will be appended to it \
  unless the ''--overwriteExisting'' argument is provided.  If this file does \
  not exist, then the parent directory must exist.  If this argument is not \
  provided, then the changes will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_OUTPUT=GZIP-compress the data as it is \
  written to the output file.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT=Encrypt the data as it is written to \
  the output file.  If the ''--outputEncryptionPassphraseFile'' argument is \
  provided, then the passphrase contained in that file will be used to \
  encrypt the output.  Otherwise, the tool will interactively prompt for the \
  passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_PW_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  passphrase to use to encrypt the contents of the output file.  If this \
  argument is provided, then the file must exist, and it must contain exactly \
  one line comprised entirely of the encryption passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OVERWRITE_EXISTING=Overwrite the output file if it \
  already exists, rather than appending to it.  This argument must be \
  provided if the output file already exists and either of the \
  ''--compressOutput'' or ''--encryptOutput'' arguments is provided.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_CONTENT=Content Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_CHANGE_TYPE='{'add|delete|modify'}'
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_CHANGE_TYPE=The type of change to include in the \
  output.  Allowed values are ''add'' (to indicate that the output should \
  include LDIF add change records for all entries that are present in the \
  target LDIF but not in the source), ''delete'' (to indicate that the output \
  should include LDIF delete change records for all entries that are present \
  in the source LDIF but not in the target), and ''modify'' (to indicate that \
  the output should include LDIF modify change records for all entries that \
  are present in both the source and target LDIF files but that differ \
  between the two versions).  This argument may be provided multiple times to \
  specify multiple change types.  By default, all change types will be \
  included.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_PLACEHOLDER_ATTRIBUTE='{'attributeName'}'
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_INCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE=Only include the specified \
  attribute in the change records that are written.  Changes that do not \
  affect the specified attribute will be omitted from the results.  This \
  argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple include \
  attributes.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_EXCLUDE_ATTRIBUTE=Exclude the specified attribute \
  from the change records that are written.  Changes that affect only the \
  specified attribute will be omitted from the results.  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple exclude attributes.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_INCLUDE_FILTER=Only include changes to entries that \
  match the given filter (either before or after the change).  This argument \
  may be provided multiple times to specify multiple include filters (in \
  which case an entry will only be included if it matches at least one of the \
  provided filters).
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_EXCLUDE_FILTER=Exclude changes to entries that match \
  the given filter (either before or after the change).  This argument may be \
  provided multiple times to specify multiple exclude filters (in which case \
  an entry will be excluded if it matches any of the provided filters).
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_INCLUDE_OPERATIONAL=Include operational attributes in \
  the output file, in both add and modify change records.  By default, only \
  user attributes will be included.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_EXCLUDE_NO_USER_MOD=Exclude operational attributes \
  declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION constraint.  This argument is only \
  applicable if the ''--includeOperationalAttributes'' argument is provided.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_NON_REVERSIBLE_MODS=Generate modify change records in \
  non-reversible form, in which attribute differences are written with the \
  ''replace'' modification type.  By default, modifications will be generated \
  in reversible form, with delete modifications to remove existing values \
  that are no longer included and add modifications to insert new values.  \
  Using reversible form is generally considered safer, as attempts to apply \
  the modifications are more likely to fail if the entry has been updated.  \
  Modifications generated in non-reversible form are more likely to succeed \
  when applied, but at a greater risk of losing changes that have been \
  processed since the LDIF files were generated.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SINGLE_VALUE_CHANGES=Generate a separate modify \
  change record for each attribute value that is to be removed from or added \
  to the target entry.  By default, all modifications to an entry will be \
  provided in a single modify change record.  If a separate modify change \
  record is generated for each attribute value, it may be easier to apply \
  changes if the data set has changed since the LDIF files were generated \
  (by instructing the tool that is applying changes to ignore failures).
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Strip off any illegal trailing \
  spaces identified in LDIF entries rather than rejecting those entries.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH_STANDALONE=The path to an LDIF file (or \
  a directory containing multiple LDIF files) with the schema definitions to \
  use during processing.  This argument may be used multiple times to specify \
  multiple schema paths.  If this argument is ot provided, the LDAP SDK''s \
  default standard schema will be used.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH_PING_SERVER=The path to an LDIF file (or \
  a directory containing multiple LDIF files) with the schema definitions to \
  use during processing.  This argument may be used multiple times to specify \
  multiple schema paths.  If this argument is ot provided, the server''s \
  schema will be used.
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_APPEND_WITH_COMPRESSION_OR_ENCRYPTION=If the output LDIF file \
  already exists, and if either the {0} or {1} argument is provided, then the \
  {2} argument must also be provided.
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_GET_SCHEMA=An error occurred while attempting to obtain \
  the schema to use during processing:  {0}

INFO_LDIF_DIFF_EXAMPLE_1=Identify the changes needed to transform the set of \
  entries contained in the ''actual.ldif'' file into the set of entries \
  contained in the ''desired.ldif'' file.  Operational attributes will be \
  ignored, and modifications will be presented in reversible form.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_EXAMPLE_2=Identify the changes needed to transform the set of \
  entries contained in the ''actual.ldif'' file into the set of entries \
  contained in the ''desired.ldif'' file.  Operational attributes not \

  may optionally be compressed or encrypted.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_LDIF_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the input LDIF \
  files.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  input LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the \
  tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_LDIF_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the target LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  target LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, and if the \
  file was not encrypted with a key from the server''s encryption settings \
  database, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Strip off any illegal trailing \
  spaces identified in LDIF entries rather than rejecting those entries.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH_STANDALONE=The path to an LDIF file (or \
  a directory containing multiple LDIF files) with the schema definitions to \
  use during processing.  This argument may be used multiple times to specify \

  automatically detect whether each file is compressed.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_GROUP_OUTPUT=Output Arguments
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_FILE=the path to an output file to which \
  matching entries will be written.  If this is not provided, then matching \
  entries will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_SEPARATE_OUTPUT_FILES=Use a separate output LDIF \
  file for each search filter.  This argument is only applicable if either \
  the --filterFile or --ldapURLFile argument is provided to specify multiple \
  sets of search criteria.  If this argument is given, then each output file \
  will use the path specified by the --outputFile argument, followed by a \
  period and a number indicating which search criteria is being used (e.g., \
  ''.1''; for the first set of search criteria, ''.2'' for the second, and so \
  on).
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_OUTPUT=GZIP-compress the data as it is \
  written to each output file.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT=Encrypt the data as it is written to \
  each output file.  If the ''--outputEncryptionPassphraseFile'' argument is \
  provided, then the passphrase contained in that file will be used to \
  encrypt the output.  Otherwise, the tool will interactively prompt for the \
  passphrase.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_PW_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  passphrase to use to encrypt the contents of the output files.  If this \
  argument is provided, then the file must exist, and it must contain exactly \
  one line comprised entirely of the encryption passphrase.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_OVERWRITE_EXISTING=Overwrite any output file that \
  already exists, rather than appending to it.  This argument must be \
  provided if the output file already exists and either of the \
  ''--compressOutput'' or ''--encryptOutput'' arguments is provided.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_WRAP_COLUMN=The column at which long lines should be \
  wrapped.  By default, long lines will be wrapped based on the terminal \
  width (or 80 columns if the terminal width cannot be determined).
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_DO_NOT_WRAP=Do not wrap long lines as they are \
  written.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_GROUP_CRITERIA=Search Criteria Arguments
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_BASE_DN=The base DN to use when searching for \
  matching entries.  This argument must not be provided if the --ldapURLFile \
  argument is given, as the base DN from each URL will be used.  If no LDAP \
  URL file is given and this argument is not provided, then the null DN will \
  be used as the search base.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_SCOPE=The scope to use when searching for matching \
  entries.  This argument must not be provided if the --ldapURLFile \
  argument is given, as the scope from each URL will be used.  If no LDAP \
  URL file is given and this argument is not provided, then a default \
  scope of ''sub'' will be used.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_FILTER_FILE=The path to a file containing one or \
  more search filters (each on a separate line) to use to identify matching \
  entries.  If neither this argument nor the --ldapURLFile argument is \
  provided, then the filter must be provided as the first trailing argument.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_LDAP_URL_FILE=The path to a file containing one or \
  more LDAP URLs (each on a separate line) with the criteria to use to \
  identify matching entries.  Note that only the base DN, scope, filter, and \
  requested attributes will be used from the LDAP URLs; the server address \
  and port (if any) will be ignored.  If neither this argument nor the \
  --filterFile argument is provided, then the filter must be provided as the \
  first trailing argument.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_SIZE_LIMIT=The maximum number of entries to return \
  for each search.  If this is not provided, then no size limit will be \
  enforced.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_ARG_DESC_TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS=The maximum length of time in \
  seconds to spend processing.  If this is not provided, then no time limit \
  will be enforced.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_APPEND_WITH_COMPRESSION_OR_ENCRYPTION=If the output LDIF file \

  {2} argument must also be provided.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_FILTER_FILE_WITH_TRAILING_FILTER=If the --filterFile argument \
  is provided, then the first unnamed trailing argument must not also be a \
  filter.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_LDAP_URL_FILE_WITH_TRAILING_ARGS=If the --ldapURLFile argument \
  is provided, then there must not be any unnamed trailing arguments.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_DIFFERENT_URL_ATTRS_IN_SAME_FILE=If the --ldapURLFile argument \
  is used to provide multiple LDAP URLs, and if all of those URLs do not have \
  the same set of requested attributes, then the \
  --separateOutputFilePerSearch argument must also be provided to ensure that \
  results from each search are written to separate output files.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_NO_FILTER=If neither the --filterFile nor --ldapURLFile \
  argument is provided, then there must be at least one unnamed trailing \
  argument, and the first such argument must be the filter to use for the \
  search.
ERR_LDIFSEARCH_FIRST_TRAILING_ARG_NOT_FILTER=When neither the --filterFile \
  nor --ldapURLFile argument is provided, the first trailing argument must be \
  a valid search filter.  ''{0}'' cannot be parsed as a valid filter.

  in LDAP URL {0}:
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_EXAMPLE_1=Search for entries with a uid value of ''jdoe'' in \
  the data.ldif file.  The matching entries will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDIFSEARCH_EXAMPLE_2=Search for all entries with the ''person'' object \
  class below ''dc=example,dc=com'' in the data.ldif file.  Write the \
  matching entries to the ''people.ldif'' file, but only include the \
  ''givenName'', ''sn'', and ''cn'' attributes.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION=Apply a set of changes (including add, \
  delete, modify, and modify DN operations) to a set of entries contained in \
  an LDIF file.  The changes will be read from a second file (containing \
  change records rather than entries), and the updated entries will be \
  written to a third LDIF file.  Unlike ldapmodify, the ldifmodify cannot \
  read the changes to apply from standard input.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=All of the change records will be read \
  into memory before processing begins, so it is important to ensure that the \
  tool is given enough memory to hold those change records.  However, it will \
  only operate on a single source entry at a time, so the size of the source \
  LDIF file does not significantly impact the amount of memory that the tool \
  requires.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=Note that the tool will attempt to \
  correctly handle multiple changes affecting the same entry.  However, \
  because it only operates on one entry at a time, it cannot always behave \
  in exactly the same way as if it were applying the changes over LDAP to a \
  server populated with the source LDIF file.  For example, it is not \
  possible to reject an attempt to delete an entry that has subordinates, so \
  any delete will be treated as a subtree delete.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4=Further, not all types of modify DN \
  change records are supported.  In particular, modify DN change records are \
  not permitted if they target any entry that has been targeted by a \
  previous change record (for example, renaming an entry that was created by \
  a previous add change record).
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_5=Finally, it cannot perform other types of \
  validation, like ensuring that all of the necessary superior entries exist \
  when adding a new entry, or ensuring that a modify DN will not introduce a \
  conflict with an existing entry.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_INPUT=Input Arguments
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_LDIF=The path to an LDIF file containing the \
  source entries to be updated.  This argument must be provided exactly once, \
  and the file must exist.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the encryption \
  passphrase.  If the source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not \
  provided, and if the file was not encrypted with a key from the server''s \
  encryption settings database, then the tool will interactively prompt for \
  the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the encryption \
  passphrase.  If the source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not \
  provided, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_CHANGES_LDIF=The path to the file containing the \
  LDIF change records that represent the changes to apply.  This argument \
  must be provided exactly once, and the file must exist.  The entire \
  contents of the file will be read into memory so that all changes will be \
  available when processing entries in the source LDIF file.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_CHANGES_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the changes LDIF \
  file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file must \
  exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the encryption \
  passphrase.  If the changes LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not \
  provided, and if the file was not encrypted with a key from the server''s \
  encryption settings database, then the tool will interactively prompt for \
  the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_CHANGES_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to the file \
  containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the changes \
  LDIF file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file \
  must exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the \
  encryption passphrase.  If the changes LDIF file is encrypted but this \
  argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt for the \
  passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Strip off any illegal trailing \
  spaces identified in LDIF entries rather than rejecting those entries.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_LENIENT_MODIFICATIONS=Be lenient when applying \
  modifications.  If this argument is provided, then neither attempts to add \
  an attribute value that already exists nor attempts to remove an attribute \
  value that does not exist will be considered an error.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_STRICT_MODIFICATIONS=Use strict mode when applying \
  modifications to entries.  If this argument is provided, then the tool \
  will report an error when trying to modify an entry to add an attribute \
  value that already exists in the entry or to remove an attribute value \
  that does not exist in the entry.  By default, the tool will operate in \
  lenient mode, and these ''no-op'' modifications will be permitted.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_IGNORE_DUPLICATE_DELETES=Ignore subsequent deletes \
  that target an entry that has already been deleted by an earlier change.  \
  By default, subsequent deletes that target an already-deleted entry will \
  be reported as an error.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_IGNORE_NONEXISTENT_DELETES=Ignore deletes that \
  target entries that do not exist in the source LDIF file.  By default, \
  deletes targeting nonexistent entries will be reported as an error.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_IGNORE_NONEXISTENT_MODIFIES=Ignore modifies that \
  target entries that do not exist in the source LDIF file.  By default, \
  modifies targeting nonexistent entries will be reported as an error.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_GROUP_OUTPUT=Output Arguments
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_TARGET_LDIF=The path to the file to which the \
  updated entries will be written.  This argument must be provided \
  exactly once.  If the path exists, then it must reference a file rather \
  than a directory, and that file will be overwritten with the updated \
  entries.  If the path does not exist, then its parent directory must exist.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_TARGET=GZIP-compress the data written to \
  the target LDIF file.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_TARGET=Encrypt the data written to the \
  target LDIF file.  If the --targetEncryptionPassphraseFile argument is \
  not provided to supply the passphrase to use to generate the encryption \
  key, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_TARGET_PW_FILE=The path to the file containing the \
  passphrase that will be used to encrypt the data as it is written to the \
  target file.  If this argument is not provided and the output file is to be \
  encrypted, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_WRAP_COLUMN=The column at which long lines should be \
  wrapped.  By default, long lines will be wrapped based on the terminal \
  width (or 80 columns if the terminal width cannot be determined).
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_DO_NOT_WRAP=Do not wrap long lines as they are \
  written.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_SUPPRESS_COMMENTS=Do not include comments in the \
  target LDIF file.  By default, each entry will include a comment to \
  indicate what changes (if any) were applied to it.
INFO_LDIFMODIFY_ARG_DESC_NO_SCHEMA_CHECK=Do not perform schema checking while \
  applying changes to entries.
ERR_LDIFMODIFY_RECOVERABLE_DECODE_ERROR=An error occurred while attempting to \
