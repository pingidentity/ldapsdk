    1. Abstract

    Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network 
    resources. It is assumed that a directory is accessed for reading and 
    searching data more than for modification purposes. Under such 
    assumptions, for performance reasons, a mechanism for caching as a 
    proxy  which caches all entries is desirable. This document describes
    a mechanism for caching directory entries. 
    This document also defines one operational attribute and two controls
    required to be implemented for the caching model.

    2. Conventions used in this document


    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [ ].


    3. Introduction

    LDAP performance would receive a boost if a caching mechanism were 
    available to cache entries so the network resources used for 
    retrieving entries wouldn't be used as much as they will otherwise. 
    This goes well with the philosophy that LDAP directories are mostly 
    read and searched than modified. Entries can be cached with the safe 
    assumption that they will not be modified very often which would lead 
    to better performance. This draft shall confine itself to a discussion 
    on caching ldap search results alone.

    4. Attribute definition
    This draft defines a rootDSE operational attribute which identifies 
    the DIT of which the server holds a replica. 

    ditName : ( <OID_to_be decided> NAME 'ditName'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 USAGE dSAOperation )

    5. Controls used for caching results
    
	
    5.1 The originServerbind Control

   The originServerbind control defines a control using which a client 
   which is routing its requests through a proxy can mention what origin
   server it needs to contact and the credentials to bind as. 

    5.1.1 Request control

    This control is included in the bindRequest message as part of the 
    controls field of the LDAPMessage, as defined in Section 4.1.12 of  
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol[LDAPv3]. The controlType is set
    to <OID to be assigned>. The criticality MAY be set to TRUE or FALSE 
    in the absence of which  the criticality is defaulted to be FALSE. 
    The ControlValue is an OCTET STRING whose value is the BER encoding 
    of the following SEQUENCE.

	OriginServerbindRequest ::= SEQUENCE {
     serverName    LDAPString -- server name or IP addr.
     serverPort    INTEGER -- the port number
     bindRequest   BindRequest OPTIONAL
	}
    The serverName is the name or the IP address of the origin LDAP server.
    If it is a name, it should include the domain name so that the server 
    is uniquely identified by the serverName in the Internet space.
    The serverPort represents the port on which the origin LDAP server 
    is running.The bindRequest contains the userDN and credentials using
    which bind can be performed on the origin server. It is as defined in
    4.2 of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAPV3].

    5.1.2 Response Control
	   The controlType is set to < To be decided >. The criticality is 
        FALSE (MAY be absent). The controlValue is an OCTET STRING, whose 
        value is the BER encoding of a value of the following SEQUENCE:

        originServerbindResponse :: = SEQUENCE {
        originServerbindResult ENUMERATED{
        success (0),
        operatonsError (1),
        strongAuthRequired(8), 
        unwillingToPerform (53),
        insufficientAccessRights (50),
        busy (51),
        inappropriateMatching (18),
        timeLimitExceeded (3),
        offsetRangeError (61),
        other (80) },
        contextID OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

    contextID is a server-defined octet string. If present, the contents 
    of the contextID field  SHOULD be returned to the server by a client 
    in a subsequent originServerbind control request. 


    This control also determines the origin server to which the client 
    wants to connect and the cache agent MUST make use of this 
    information to connect to the origin server. In absence of the 
    bindRequest entity, the information with which client sends across in 
    its bind request to the caching agent SHOULD be used to connect to 
    the origin server.

    The result of the control shall determine whether the origin server 
    can be contacted or not. If the origin server is not contactible, the 
    proxy SHOULD  return operationsError. Based on that the client can 
    make a decision as to whether the cached results be made use of or not.

    5.2 Cached Search control

     The document also defines the cachedResults control which specifies 
    whether the searches can be retrieved from the cache or it must needs 
    be retrieved directly from the target server. 

    5.2.1 Request Control

   This control is included in the searchRequest message as part of the  
    controls field of the LDAPMessage, as defined in Section 4.1.12 of 
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAPv3]. The controlType is 
    set to <OID to be assigned>. The criticality MAY be set to TRUE or 
    FALSE in the absence of which the criticality is defaulted to be 
    FALSE. The ControlValue is NULL. 
   
   5.2.2 Response Control :

   The controlType is set to <To be decided>. The criticality is
   FALSE (MAY be absent). The controlValue is an OCTET STRING, whose
   value is the BER encoding of a value of the following SEQUENCE:

   cacheResultResponse :: = SEQUENCE {
   cacheResult ENUMERATED{
   success (0),
   operatonsError (1),
   strongAuthRequired(8), 
   unwillingToPerform (53),
   insufficientAccessRights (50),
   busy (51),
   inappropriateMatching (18),
   timeLimitExceeded (3),
   offsetRangeError (61),
   other (80) },
   targetServerResponse ENUMERATED
    {
	originNotresponding  (0), --origin server closed connection
	allFromCache	     (1), -- all info from cache
	allFromorigin	     (2), -- all info from origin	
	partial		     (3), -- partially from either	
	}   

        contextID OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

    contextID is a server-defined octet string. If present, the contents 
    of the contextID field  SHOULD be returned to the server by a client 
    in a subsequent cacheResult control. 

    targetServerResponse is used to determine whether the response is 
    fully from the caching agent, fully from the origin server or partly 
    from the cache and partly from the origin server. The 
    originNotresponding entity functions to see that the client is 
    informed if midway through the operation, the origin server goes down 
    or is inaccessible.

      The caching agent will find whether the criticality of the control 
    is TRUE or FALSE. If the criticality is FALSE, it will execute the 
    operation as described above. If the criticality is TRUE, it will 
    strip away the control and send across the request to the desired 
    server.


    6. The LDAP caching model

    An LDAP search request consists primarily of sending a filter to a
    particular server and getting all the entries which match that filter 
    along with some or all of their attributes.  The query can be on 
    multiple servers holding the same DIT or multiple servers holding 
    multiple DITs. The model assumes an active proxy agent or caching 
    agent which shall intercept the client request and the server 
    response and shall, based on configuration options, decide whether to 
    cache the entries or not. The rest of the draft assumes that 
    configuration options are such that the requests from the client are 
    deemed cacheable unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. Configuration  
    options are discussed later in this draft.

    The caching agent shall intercept the LDAP search request from the 
    client and look up the server to which the request is being sent. It 
    shall send the request to the server and simultaneously query the 
    server for its ditName  operational attribute. The response from the 
    server shall be accepted by the proxy agent and sent to the client. 
    The agent shall group all the entries under a container which shall 
    be identified by the ditName and shall conceptually represent that 
    DIT. Under this DIT container the entry shall be created with all the 
    hierarchy intact. Thus if a user entry which exists some levels down 
    the DIT root is returned, the agent would create the entry after 
    creating all the containers under which the entry exists in that order.
    Along with this request, the agent shall query for the modifyTimestamp 
    operational attribute of all the objects retrieved and store them for
    caching reference. For the caching model to work, the modifyTimestamp 
    attribute of the objects retrieved needs to be accessible to the 
    caching agent. This can be provided either through binding as an 
    entry which has access to the modifyTimestamp   attribute or by 
    allowing anonymous access to the same.   The agent may make successive 
    requests to the containers along with their which  contain the entry 
    to get the data for the containers and store them for future reference. 
    Subsequent searches shall involve a query of the modifyTimeStamp 
    attribute of the objects returnable by the filter and the DNs returned 
    shall be matched with the objects already available in the cache. 
    There are three cases of what could happen and the corresponding 
    actions to be taken.

    i)	If the objects are all available in the cache and the 
        modifyTimestamp of all the objects are the same as the 
        modifyTimestamp of the objects in the cache, then the cached 
        objects are returned.

    ii)	If the objects are all available in the cache and the 
        modifyTimestamp of some of the objects are greater then what 
        exists in the cache, then a base search for those objects will be
        performed along with the filter specified and those entries shall 
        be returned. Simultaneously the cache shall also be updated to 
        reflect these changes. The modifyTimestamp of these objects shall
        also be modified in the cache accordingly. 


    iii) If the objects are not all available in the cache, fresh            
         base searches shall be made for the objects not available 
         in the cache. These shall be cached along with their 
         modifyTimestamp attributes.

    If the number of changed or non-present objects are more than the 
    number of unchanged objects, the cache agent  MAY choose to execute a 
    fresh search of the DIT using the filter.


    7. Access controls

    Depending on the configuration of the proxy, it MAY cache Access 
    Control Information for the bindDN on the list of objects returned 
    using the ldapGetEffectiveRights extension as defined in [ACL]. 
    Subsequent requests for the object data shall be returned depending on 
    the access rights to the list of objects returned. If the ACL 
    information for different subject DNs are not cached or access to 
    the ACL information is denied, the agent MUST cache only anonymous 
    bind results.
	If the search is a non-anonymous one having a pertinent bind 
    entity, the ACLs corresponding to that subject should be cached.  
    Subsequent searches by the same entity in further sessions MUST be 
    authenticated either to the origin server or the cache before results 
    are returned from either the cache or the origin server. Subsequent 
    drafts will define authentication mechanisms in a cache.

    8. Configuration options

    The configuration options can be:

    i) All the entries need to be cached.

   ii) None of the entries need to be cached.

  iii) Entries under a particular DN need to be cached. In this case, if 
       the search request does not pertain to entries under the DN or 
       pertains partly to entries under the DN, the request will become a
       regular search request.

   Other complex configuration options can also be provided.

    9. Diverse schema 

    The basic LDAP Schema SHOULD be supported by the proxy server. 
    Additional attributes and object classes may be supported. Schema 
    changes to the parent directory may be "learnt" by the cache agent 
    and implemented. If the request returns any entries the schema of 
    which is not recognised by the cache, it may try to learn the schema 
    using subschema search mechanisms. However if it does not learn the 
    schema, the non-recognised entries MUST NOT be cached.
 

    10. Operation in disconnected mode

    The cached results can also help provide information when the origin 
    server is not up. In this case, when the origin server is not running, 
    i.e. when the caching agent cannot connect to the origin server, the 
    client can use the cacheResult control to get the information from the
    cache and make use of it. 

    11. Security Considerations

    Security would be a chief issue if Access Controls were retrieved and 
    cached. The cache agent would have to adhere to access restrictions 
    placed on the objects and their attributes. In particular, if a 
    subject binds as an entity granted more privileges, then the ACLs of 
    that entity need to be cached and based on that ACI, the search results 
    need to be serviced. Further drafts may expound the principle of 
    retrieving and caching ACI probably based on ldapGetEffectiveRights 
    extension or using the getEffectiveRights control [ACLs]. 
    However a restricted access i.e. don∆t-allow-access-unless-absolutely-
    sure mechanism is to be followed if determinacy is not accurate as to 
    whether a subject can be allowed or denied access to an entity.
