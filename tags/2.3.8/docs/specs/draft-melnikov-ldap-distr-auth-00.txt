Internet DRAFT     Distributed authentication in LDAP       12 July 2004


Abstract


   This document was prompted by a desire to allow deployments of
   distributed SASL implementations, so that all authentication can be
   performed in a one central place. It tries to fulfill the following
   requirements:

   1) The SASL framework is client/server authentication, but it doesn't
   preclude either the client or the server implementations from being
   distributed.

   2) It might be also desirable to proxy an authentication exchange
   whether it was initiated over LDAP or another SASL-supporting
   protocol.

   This document defines a Distributed Authentication LDAP extended
   operation, that enables applications (including LDAP proxies and
   gateways) that authenticate using SASL, to use LDAP for performing
   authentication, by forwarding the SASL authentication requests to an
   LDAP server.


1.    Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

   All Basic Encoding Rules (BER)[BER] encodings follow the conventions
   found in Section 5.1 of [RFC2251].

2.    Distributed authentication Request and Response


2.1.  Distributed authentication Request


   The Distributed authentication Request is sent as an LDAP extended
   operation. The requestName is 1.3.6.1.4.1.453.23.1. The requestValue
   is the BER [BER] encoding of the following ChainedAuthRequestValue
   ASN.1 definition.

   ChainedAuthRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
        bindRequest             BindRequest,
        chainingAuthArguments   ChainingAuthArguments }

   ChainingAuthArguments ::= SEQUENCE {

   BindRequest and Controls are defined in [RFC2251].

   <<serviceName, serviceProtocol, serverHostname, clientEndpoint and
   serverEndpoint MUST NOT change between any 2 steps of the same
   authentication exchange.>>

2.2.  Distributed authentication Response


   The Distributed authentication Response is sent as an LDAP extended
   operation. The  requestName is omitted. The requestValue is the BER
   [BER] encoding of the following ChainedAuthResponse ASN.1 definition.



Melnikov & Zeilenga                                     FORMFEED[Page 3]





Internet DRAFT     Distributed authentication in LDAP       12 July 2004

        bindResponse            BindResponse,
        controls                [0] Controls OPTIONAL,
        ... }

   <<Do we need to pass back any additional data? Like some sort of ID
   associated with the enclosed bind exchange?>>

   <<Do we need new error codes?>>

   BindResponse and Controls are defined in [RFC2251].

2.3.  Semantics of Distributed authentication Request and Response


   In order to avoid confusion, this section will use the following 3
   terms to define parties involved in a Distributed Authentication
   exchange.  The term "server" refers to an LDAP server which is the
   recipient of Distribution Authentication Request. The term "client"
   refers to an LDAP client which sends the Distribution Authentication
   Request. The "client" also acts as a SASL server (in a normal sense
   of this word) for another authentication exchange, which is happening
   between an "application" and the "client". The authentication
   exchange may be carried by any SASL-supporting protocol, which is not
   necessarily LDAP.

   A Distributed authentication Request consist of a bind Request
   information, together with some additional information that would
   enable the server to perform authentication on client's behalf. The
   additional information is described by chainingAuthArguments.

   In a case when the client is an application level gateway between
   another SASL-supporting protocol and LDAP, the
   chainingAuthArguments.serviceName must be set to the service name
   [GSSAPI] of the protocol used to carry out authentication exchange
   between the application and the client.  For example, if the client
   is an SMTP server [SMTP] this value would be set to "smtp".

   The chainingAuthArguments.serviceProtocol is set to 0 (i.e. TCP) by
   default.  This field is reserved for future extensibility when the
   authentication exchange between the application and the client
   doesn't happen over TCP.

   The chainingAuthArguments.serverHostname is the fully qualified
   hostname that was used by the client when it has accepted the
   original authentication request from the application. This field is
   required, because the client may, for example, listen on multiple
   interfaces that may have different hostnames associated with them.

Internet DRAFT     Distributed authentication in LDAP       12 July 2004


   The chainingAuthArguments.clientEndpoint and
   chainingAuthArguments.serverEndpoint define connection endpoint
   information for the authentication exchange carried out between the
   application and the client respectively.

   The chainingAuthArguments.controls member contains controls that are
   associated with the bindResponse. The controls serve the same purpose
   as controls attached to a bind request.

3.   Security considerations


   Distributed authentication extended operation assumes that both
   endpoints are secure. A compromise of one endpoint may make it
   possible to use the operation to mount a MITM attack. <<More details
   here?>>

   An LDAP server should (<<SHOULD?>>) only accept Distributed
   authentication Requests from trusted peers and only over properly
   protected channel.  It is recommended that before issuing the
   Distributed authentication operation the protocol peers:

    - establish each other identities through appropriate authentication
      mechanism,
    - establish appropriate data integrity, data confidentiality, and
      other protections,
    - establish an LDAP association between the initiating peer and the
      responding peer.

   Servers may place access control or other restrictions upon the use
   of this operation.

   As with any other extended operations, general LDAP security
   considerations [RFC3377] apply.

4.   IANA Considerations


   This OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.453.23.1 to identify the LDAP Distributed
   authentication extended operation. This OID was assigned by Isode
   Limited, under its IANA-assigned private enterprise allocation
   [PRIVATE], for use in this specification.

   Registration of this protocol mechansism is requested [RFC3383].
