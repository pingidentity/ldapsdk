/**
 * This package contains a number of simple programs that intend to demonstrate
 * how to use the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java to perform various types of
 * operations.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Note that the scope of these programs has been intentionally kept small so
 * that they are easier to understand, even though this may limit the real-world
 * usefulness of these examples.  Further, these programs do not include
 * support for internationalization and have minimal debugging code to further
 * simplify them.
