1.  Introduction

   This document registers 2 new SASL [RFC4422] mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-512
   and SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS, which are variants of Salted Challenge
   Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) [RFC5802].  SHA-512 has
   stronger security properties than SHA-1, and it is expected that
   SCRAM mechanisms based on it will have greater predicted longevity
   than the SCRAM mechanisms based on SHA-1.

2.  Key Word Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

3.  SCRAM-SHA-512 and SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS

   The SCRAM-SHA-512 and SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS SASL mechanisms are defined
   in the same way that SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS are defined in
   [RFC5802], except that the hash function for HMAC() and H() uses
   SHA-512 instead of SHA-1 [RFC6234].

   For the SCRAM-SHA-512 and SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS SASL mechanisms, the
   hash iteration-count announced by a server SHOULD be at least 10000.

   The GSS-API mechanism OID for SCRAM-SHA-512 is 1.3.6.1.5.5.<TBD> (see
   Section 5).

   [[TBD: Add an example]]

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5802] still apply.

Internet-Draft    SASL SCRAM-SHA-512/SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS    December 2024


   To be secure, SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS MUST be used over a TLS channel that
   has had the session hash extension [RFC7627] negotiated, or session
   resumption MUST NOT have been used.  When using SCRAM over TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246], the "tls-unique" channel binding is still the default
   channel binding to use (see Section 6.1 of [RFC5802]), assuming the
   above conditions are satisfied.  As "tls-unique" channel binding is
   not defined for TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], when using SCRAM over TLS 1.3, the
   "tls-exporter" channel binding [RFC9266] MUST be the default channel
   binding (in the sense specified in Section 6.1 of [RFC5802]) to use.

   See [RFC4270] and [RFC6194] for reasons to move from SHA-1 to a
   strong security mechanism like SHA-512.

   The strength of this mechanism is dependent in part on the hash
   iteration-count, as denoted by "i" in [RFC5802].  As a rule of thumb,
   the hash iteration-count should be such that a modern machine will
   take 0.1 seconds to perform the complete algorithm; however, this is
   unlikely to be practical on mobile devices and other relatively low-
   performance systems.  At the time this was written, the rule of thumb
   gives around 15,000 iterations required; however, a hash iteration-
   count of 10000 takes around 0.5 seconds on current mobile handsets.
   This computational cost can be avoided by caching the ClientKey
   (assuming the Salt and hash iteration-count is stable).  Therefore,
   the recommendation of this specification is that the hash iteration-
   count SHOULD be at least 10000, but careful consideration ought to be
   given to using a significantly higher value, particularly where
   mobile use is less important.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following new SASL SCRAM mechanisms to
   the "SASL SCRAM Family Mechanisms" registry:
