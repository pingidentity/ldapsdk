              SCRAM with Modular Crypt Format (SCRAM-MCF)
                       draft-bouchez-scram-mcf-01

Abstract

   This document specifies SCRAM-MCF, an extension to the Salted
   Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) family of SASL
   mechanisms ([RFC5802]) and HTTP Digest extensions ([RFC7616],
   [RFC7677]).

   The extension replaces the PBKDF2-specific iteration count attributes
   i= and s= in the server-first-message with a generic Modular Crypt
   Format (MCF) descriptor f=. This allows servers to use modern memory-
   hard key derivation functions such as Argon2, SCrypt, or bcrypt while
   preserving the full security properties and message flow of SCRAM.

   The change is fully backward compatible: servers can continue sending
   i= and s= for legacy clients and only send f= (or both) when the
   client advertises support.

   This document is intended to be discussed and potentially adopted by
   the KITTEN working group.  Feedback from the KITTEN WG is welcome on
   the kitten@ietf.org mailing list.

1.  Introduction

   SCRAM as defined in [RFC5802] and its SHA-256 variant in [RFC7677] is
   widely deployed (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, SASL libraries, etc.).
   Its only key derivation function is PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1 or PBKDF2-HMAC-
   SHA-256.  PBKDF2 is no longer considered state-of-the-art against
   GPU/ASIC-based password cracking.

Internet-Draft                  SCRAM-MCF                  November 2025


   Modern password hashing algorithms (Argon2 – winner of the 2015
   Password Hashing Competition, SCrypt, bcrypt) are memory-hard and far
   more resistant to parallel brute-force attacks.  However, replacing
   SCRAM entirely with a new mechanism is unnecessary: the core proof-
   of-possession construction of SCRAM is excellent.  Only the key
   derivation step needs to become negotiable.

   This document defines the smallest possible standards-compliant
   extension that achieves exactly that.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The term "Modular Crypt Format" (MCF) refers to the de-facto standard
   string format used by crypt(3), Passlib, Spring Security, and most
   modern password hashing libraries.  Examples:

   $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=2,p=4$z8e0jsE2kz7z6...$7KX4Wm6Q7f...
   $scrypt$ln=16,r=8,p=1$z8e0jsE2kz7z6uL0m4zZ6Q$7KX4Wm6Q7...

3.  SCRAM-MCF Extension

3.1.  Client Capability Advertisement

   A client that implements SCRAM-MCF MUST include the attribute f=y in
   the reserved extension field of the client-first-message when using
   any SCRAM mechanism that supports this extension.

   Example (client-first-message):

   n,,n=user,r=fyko+d2lbbFgONRv9qkxdawL,f=y

   Clients that do not send f=y MUST be treated exactly as in the
   original SCRAM algorithm (legacy clients).  They MUST NOT support the
   f= attribute if they did not send f=y first.

   The f= attribute name - as in "format" - was selected because
   [RFC5802] states that names are single US-ASCII letters, and that m=
   is already reserved.

Internet-Draft                  SCRAM-MCF                  November 2025


3.2.  Server-first-message Changes

   A server that receives f=y and wishes to use a modern KDF MUST
   respond with the attribute f= instead of i= and s=.

   The value of f= is the full MCF identifier string up to but not
   including the final stored hash part, encoded as base-64.  In other
   words: everything up to and including the base64-encoded salt and its
   trailing $ character (if any), then converted to base-64.  The MCF
   identifier MUST be converted to base-64, to ensure no commas signs
   appear in the attribute value.

   Valid examples of MCF identifiers:

   $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=2,p=4$z8e0jsE2kz7z6uL0m4zZ6Q$
   $scrypt$ln=16,r=8,p=1$z8e0jsE2kz7z6uL0m4zZ6Q$
   $2a$06$m0CrhHm10qJ3lXRY.5zDGO

   Values transmitted as f= attribute, after base-64 encoding:

   f=JGFyZ29uMmlkJHY9MTkkbT02NTUzNix0PTIscD00JHo4ZTBqc0Uya3o3ejZ1...
   f=JHNjcnlwdCRsbj0xNixyPTgscD0xJHo4ZTBqc0Uya3o3ejZ1TDBtNHpaNlEk
   f=JDJhJDA2JG0wQ3JoSG0xMHFKM2xYUlkuNXpER08=

   Backward compatibility fallback: If the server cannot or does not
   want to use MCF, it simply omits f= and sends the normal i= and s=
   attributes.

3.3.  Client Processing Rules

   *  If the server-first-message contains f=, the client MUST ignore
      any i= and s= attributes and MUST use the specified MCF string,
      after proper base-64 decoding, to derive SaltedPassword exactly as
      if it were calling the standard password-to-key function of that
      algorithm with the cleartext password and the MCF parameters/salt.

   *  The full encoded output of this MCF KDF, including its identifier,
      parameters, salt and checksum, MUST become the SaltedPassword as
      in [RFC5802] Section 3.

   *  The rest of the protocol (ClientKey, ServerKey, AuthMessage,
      ClientProof, etc.) is unchanged.

   *  The H() and HMAC() functions used to compute the client and server
      proofs MUST follow the SASL negotiation, e.g. SHA-256 and HMAC-
      SHA-256 for "SCRAM-SHA-256" or SHA-512 and HMAC-SHA-512 for
      "SCRAM-SHA-512".

   *  If the client does not recognize or support the MCF identifier, it
      MUST respond with a SASL/HTTP error (e.g., "invalid-parameters").

3.4.  SCRAM-MCF Algorithm Overview

   The following is a description of the algorithms used in a full,
   uncompressed SASL SCRAM-MCF authentication exchange.

   // SCRAM-MCF password KDF
   SaltedPassword = MCF(Password, identifier, parameters, salt)
   // using MCF prefix identifier, parameters and salt
   // e.g. "$2a$06$m0CrhHm10qJ3lXRY.5zDGO3rS2Kd..."

   // initial server storage
   ClientKey       := HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   StoredKey       := H(ClientKey)
   ServerKey       := HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")
   persist the MCF prefix, StoredKey and ServerKey in the DB

   // client
   ClientKey       := HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   ClientSignature := HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   return ClientProof := ClientKey XOR ClientSignature

   // server
   ClientSignature      := HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   CandidateClientKey   := ClientProof XOR ClientSignature
   Checks: H(CandidateClientKey) == StoredKey
   return ServerProof := HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

   // client verifies
   ServerSignature := ServerProof XOR ClientSignature
   Checks: ServerSignature == HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

   The rest of these messages is defined in [RFC5802] Section 7.

3.5.  Server Storage Recommendation

   Servers MUST store the MCF prefix string (identifier + parameters +
   salt) for each user.  For security reasons, the MCF checksum part
   MUST NOT be persisted; instead, the SCRAM-derived StoredKey and
   ServerKey MUST be stored.

   Servers MAY store and accept other SCRAM hashes (e.g., SCRAM-SHA-1 or
   SCRAM-SHA-256) for backward compatibility.  But restricting to the
   safest algorithms (like SCRAM-MCF) is strongly recommended.

4.  Formal ABNF Changes (augmented from RFC 5802)

   server-first-message = ( scram-attr-val "," )* "r=" nonce
                          [ "," "s=" base64 ]
                          [ "," "i=" posint ]
                          [ "," "f=" mcf-base64 ]
                          *( "," scram-extension )

   mcf-base64     = base64( mcf-descriptor )
   mcf-descriptor = "$" mcf-id "$" mcf-params "$" base64-salt [ "$" ]
   mcf-id         = "argon2i" / "argon2d" / "argon2id" /
                    "scrypt" / "2b" / other registered identifiers

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Preservation of the SCRAM Proof Construction

   In respect to the standard SCRAM mechanism, this SCRAM-MCF extension
   could be evaluated as such:

   *  The extension preserves channel binding, proof-of-possession, and
      mutual authentication exactly as in SCRAM.

   *  Memory-hard KDFs dramatically increase the cost of offline
      dictionary attacks.

   *  Because the KDF identifier and parameters are sent in the clear
      (as in standard SCRAM with i=), no new information is leaked to an
      eavesdropper.

   *  MCF algorithms MUST use a cryptographically random per-user salt.

   *  Clients and servers MUST reject weak MCF parameters (see "Minimum
      Acceptable" column in Section 5.2).

   *  Thanks to the MCF registration mechanism, this SCRAM-MCF pattern
      was designed to be future-proof.

   *  Weaker "SCRAM-SHA-1" MUST be rejected when used with the f=
      extension.

5.2.  Minimum and Recommended MCF Parameters Levels

   MCF parameters levels are informed by NIST SP 800-63B
   [NIST.SP.800-63B] (preferring Argon2id with memory-hard properties)
   and OWASP guidelines [OWASP.PasswordStorage].

   Tune iteratively based on client load; aim for ~500ms-1s per
   verification to balance security and usability.  Note that the server
   load is not affected by the MCF parameters, since during SCRAM
   authentication, the password derivation is done on the client side.
   For performance and Denial Of Service (DoS) mitigation, consider
   rate-limit derivations, e.g. testing with RFC 5802 [RFC5802] tools.

5.3.  Using MCF-Derived Outputs as HMAC Keys

   As defined above, ClientKey and ServerKey are computed using HMAC()
   on the MCF output.  The length and structure of this value differ
   from PBKDF2, as used in classic SCRAM.

   HMAC constructions (including HMAC-SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-512 refered
   by this document) are provably secure even when the supplied key is
   long or non-uniform.  Per Bellare, Canetti, and Krawczyk (1997;
   2006), HMAC guarantees pseudorandomness provided that:

   *  keys longer than the hash function block size are reduced by
      hashing (as mandated by HMAC), and

   *  keys of arbitrary internal structure are permitted.

   Thus, MCF outputs — even if longer than a SHA-2 block — are
   acceptable and safe HMAC keys.  Because memory-hard KDFs generate
   outputs indistinguishable from random to an attacker lacking the
   password, the resulting SaltedPassword is at least as strong as the
   PBKDF2-derived SaltedPassword in classic SCRAM.

   Therefore, replacing PBKDF2 output with memory-hard KDF output does
   not weaken the HMAC-based authentication proofs of SCRAM.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA registration of the SASL/GS2 extension
   attribute f=y and the server-first-message attribute f.

   No new SASL mechanism name ("SCRAM-MCF-*") needs to be registered.
   The existing names "SCRAM-SHA-256", "SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS", "SCRAM-SHA-
   512", etc. continue to identify the underlying H() and HMAC()
   functions used for the proof calculation.

7.  SCRAM Authentication Exchange

   This is a simple example of a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange
   when the client doesn't support channel bindings (username 'user' and
   password 'pencil' are used, with SCrypt MCF hashing):

C: n,,n=user,r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO,f=y
S: r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO%hvYDpWUa2RaTCAfuxFIlj)hNlF$k0,f=
JHNjcnlwdCRsbj00LHI9OCxwPTEkUU54NE40NTRwcE1lS21Eanh5cmhzaDdRL1BZQlF3JA==
C: c=biws,r=rOprNGfwEbeRWgbNEkqO%hvYDpWUa2RaTCAfuxFIlj)hNlF$k0,

S: v=2c7tBGYYY8tx/oLZNhZVJnjQKWeku17ZDaV0Jh3Hvmo=

   The corresponding MCF prefix string is
   "$scrypt$ln=4,r=8,p=1$QNx4N454ppMeKmDjxyrhsh7Q/PYBQw$", which is
   base-64 encoded in the f= attribute above.

8.  Acknowledgments

   The idea of using Modular Crypt Format inside a SCRAM-like flow was
   first implemented by the author in the Synopse mORMot 2 Framework in
   2025 and standardized as the wire-level extension described in this
   document.

   The author would like to thank the PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SASL
   communities for their prior art and feedback on modernizing password
   hashing in authentication protocols.  A special thanks to Simon
   Josefsson and Thilo Molitor for their very valuable feedback to our
   initial proposal.
