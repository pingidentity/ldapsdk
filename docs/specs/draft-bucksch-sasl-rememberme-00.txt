                    draft-bucksch-sasl-rememberme-00

Abstract

   Introduces a SASL mechanism that allows the application to stay
   logged in and re-login without user interaction, after completing a
   time-consuming SASL login mechanism that involves the user.

1.  Introduction

   A client application might at first log in to a server using Passkey
   or multi-factor authentication.  However, these mechanisms require
   complicated user interaction.  These are too costly to perform at
   every login.  They can realistically only be completed once during
   setup.  To stay logged in, this SASL mechanism allows the server to
   create a client-specific token that the client application can then
   use to log in to the same account, without further user interaction.

   The token is opaque to the client and the server can choose how to
   implement it.  It may be a custom random string that the server
   stores, or an application-specific password generated for this client
   together with the username, or a JWT token, or a refresh token which
   does not expire.

2.  Creation of the token

   The client requests the token from the server using either 1.
   application-specific commands, like IMAP REMEMBERME, which are to be
   defined in other standards. 2. the success response of another SASL
   mechanism.

   The client stores the token, instead of a password, in a client-
   specific storage that is as secure as a password storage.

3.  Login using the token

   If the client needs to log in and has a token for this user and host,
   uses the SASL REMEMBERME mechanism to log in.  REMEMBERME mechanism
   starts with the client sending the initial client response, which has
   the following format defined using ABNF:

   rememberme-client-step1 = token
   token                   = 1*OCTET

   If the server accepts the response as valid and allows login, it
   responds with a SASL success response.  The user is logged in.
   (ALTERNATIVE EXPIRY: ....  it responds with a SASL success response,
   a new token, and the expiry time of the new token.  The user is
   logged in.  To avoid race conditions in clients that open multiple
   connections at the same time, the previously used token MUST be valid
   for at least 30 more seconds.  Likewise, if the server returned a new
   token, then it must return the same new token in response to the same
   old token for the next 1 hour.  Reason: If the client opens 5
   connections at the same time, using the same token, but the server
   were to respond with 5 different new tokens, and it were to allow
   only 1 of them, then the client would not know which one to store,
   due to race conditions in the network response.)

   If the response is invalid, the server responds with a SASL error and
   a human-readable error message for the end user.

   server-final-message = server-error "," server-error-message
           ; Only returned on error. Omitted on success.

   server-error = "e=" server-error-value

   server-error-value = "invalid-encoding" /
                        "unknown-user" /
                        "invalid-username-encoding" /
                          ; invalid username encoding (invalid UTF-8 or
                          ; SASLprep failed)
                        "other-error" /
                        server-error-value-ext
           ; Unrecognized errors should be treated as "other-error".
           ; In order to prevent information disclosure, the server
           ; may substitute the real reason with "other-error".

   server-error-value-ext = value
           ; Additional error reasons added by extensions
           ; to this document.

   server-error-message = "m=" server-error-message-value

   server-error-message-value = 1*OCTET
           ; Human readable error message in UTF-8

4.  IMAP Example

   In IMAP, the exchange would be:

   S: * OK ACME IMAP Server v1.23 is ready
   C: 22 CAPABILITY
   S: 22 CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 IMAP4rev2 AUTH=PASSKEY AUTH=REMEMBERME
   C: 23 AUTHENTICATE REMEMBERME QUVDNjU3NjU3NjU1Nwo=
   S: 23 OK AUTHENTICATE completed

   In the above example the token is "AEC6576576557" which is
   base64-encoded according to IMAP SASL profile.

5.  Requirements on the token

   1.  The token MUST also allow the server to infer the authentication
       identity (e.g. username or email address).  The token alone must
       be sufficient to log in.  This SASL mechanism doesn't support
       separate authorization identities.

   2.  The token MUST NOT expire.  (ALTERNATIVE EXPIRY: The token MUST
       be valid for at least 30 days.)

   3.  The server SHOULD be able to revoke the tokens, in case this
       specific user account or device was compromised.  In this case,
       the authentication MUST fail and the SASL error message MUST
       explain the situation to the user and give instructions how to
       remedy the situation.

6.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

7.  Security Considerations

   Clients should treat the token like a password and store it securely.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the SASL Mechanism
   registry established by [RFC4422]:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of a new SASL mechanism REMEMBERME

   SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family): REMEMBERME
   Security considerations: Section YY of [RFCXXXX]
   Published specification (optional, recommended): [RFCXXXX]
