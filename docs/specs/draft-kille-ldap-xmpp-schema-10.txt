             LDAP Schema for supporting XMPP in White Pages
                    draft-kille-ldap-xmpp-schema-10

Abstract

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) identifies
   users by use of JID (Jabber IDs).  Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) enables provision of a white pages service with
   schema relating to users and support for internet protocols.  This
   specification defines schema to enable XMPP JIDs to be associated
   with objects in an LDAP directory so that this information can be
   used with white pages applications.

1.  Introduction

   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]
   identifies users by use of JID (Jabber IDs).  Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510] enables provision of a white pages
   service with schema relating to users and support for internet
   protocols defined in [RFC4519].  This specification defines schema to
   enable XMPP JIDs to be associated with LDAP directory objects so that
   this information can be used with white pages applications.

   The LDAP schema for storing JIDs is defined to enable JIDs to be
   associated with any object stored in the directory.  This is done by
   associating the new JID Attribute with a new Auxiliary Object Class
   (JIDObject).

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Schema Definition

   This section defines the schema used to store JIDs in the directory.

3.1.  Object Class

   This section defines a new Auxiliary Object Class (JIDObject) which
   MAY be associated with any structural Object Class.  This Object
   Class is used to augment entries for objects that act or may act as
   an XMPP client.  The JID attribute is optional, to enable configuring

   an object that is allowed to have an associated JID but does not
   currently have one.

        ( 1.3.6.1.1.23.1 NAME 'JIDObject'
        AUXILIARY
        MAY jid )

3.2.  Attribute

   This section defines the JID attribute referenced by the JIDObject
   Auxiliary Object Class.  The syntax of the JID attribute MUST follow
   the rules of [RFC7622].  The JID stored MUST be a bare JID (e.g., a
   JID such as romeo@shakespeare.example.com representing a human user)
   and not a full JID (e.g. a JID such as romeo@shakespare.example.com/
   AABBCC representing a specific XMPP client used by the human user and
   identified by the resource AABBCC).  Note that the LDAP directory
   server is not expected to enforce this syntax.  The syntax rules are
   for LDAP clients setting this attribute, noting that human usage is a
   key target.  Applications using this attribute should format that
   string in a manner appropriate to the application and XMPP
   applications SHOULD apply [RFC7622] to the attribute.  The directory
   service doesn't enforce the JID syntax and values are compared
   according to the matching rules specified in the attribute
   definition.

   NOTE: The directory string syntax and the caseIgnoreMatch matching
   rule are chosen to allow entry and matching of values according to
   common rules used within the directory, for convenience for users and
   administrators as well as implementers.  As this syntax and matching
   rules differs from [RFC7622] false positive and false negative can
   possibly occur.  This is not anticipated to cause operational issues
   (based on implementation experience with similar syntax/matching rule
   mismatches).

         ( 1.3.6.1.1.23.2 NAME 'jid'
            EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
            SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
            SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 refers to the Directory String syntax
   defined in [RFC4517].

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following registrations have been made in the LDAP Registry
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/ldap-parameters/ldap-
   parameters.xhtml> in line with BCP 64 [RFC4520].

   Object Identifier Registration

   An object identifier has been assigned to support the registrations
   necessary for this specification, by an entry in the Internet
   Directory Numbers (iso.org.dod.internet.directory [1.3.6.1.1.])
   registry:

               Decimal: 23
               Name: xmpp
               Description: LDAP schema for XMPP

   Two object identifiers have been assigned:

   'JIDObject' Descriptor Registration

               Name: JIDObject
               Type: O
               OID: 1.3.6.1.1.23.1

   'jid' Descriptor Registration

               Name: jid
               Type: A
               OID: 1.3.6.1.1.23.2

5.  Security Considerations

   XMPP JIDs are often personal identifiers enabling electronic
   communication, with similar considerations to email addresses.  This
   schema enables publishing of this information in LDAP directories
   which may be corporate or public services.  Care should be taken to
   only publish JID information which is acceptable to be linked to the
   LDAP object and be made accessible to all LDAP users.  The general
   LDAP Security Considerations specified in [RFC4510] also apply.
