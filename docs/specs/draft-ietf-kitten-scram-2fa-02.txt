      Extensions to Salted Challenge Response (SCRAM) for 2 factor
                             authentication
                     draft-ietf-kitten-scram-2fa-02

Abstract

   This specification describes an extension to family of Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL; RFC 4422) authentication
   mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication
   Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides support for 2 factor
   authentication.  It also includes a separate extension for quick
   reauthentication.

   This specification also gives an example of how TOTP (RFC 6238) can
   be used as the second factor.

1.  Introduction

   SCRAM [RFC5802] is a password based SASL [RFC4422] authentication
   mechanism that provides (among other things) mutual authentication
   and binding to an external security layer such as TLS.

   Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to add additional security
   to an authentication exchange.  The first "factor" is a password.
   The second "factor" is a verification code retrieved from an
   application on a mobile device or computer.  2FA is conceptually
   similar to a security token device that banks in some countries
   require for online banking.  Some examples of 2FA systems are OTP
   (one-time password) and TOTP (Time-based One-time Password algorithm,
   such as [RFC6238]).

   This specification describes an extension to SCRAM to provide 2
   factor authentication.  SCRAM already relies on passwords for
   authentication.  This document specifies how second "factors" can be
   incorporated into SCRAM authentication.  It also includes a separate
   (but frequently used together with the 2 factor authentication)
   extension for quick reauthentication.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Formal syntax is defined by [RFC5234] including the core rules
   defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].

   Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
   prefaced by "S:" by the server.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label
   applies to multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines
   are for editorial clarity only, and are not part of the actual
   protocol exchange.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document uses several terms defined in [RFC4949] ("Internet
   Security Glossary") including the following: authentication,
   authentication exchange, authentication information, brute force,
   challenge-response, cryptographic hash function, dictionary attack,
   eavesdropping, hash result, keyed hash, man-in-the-middle, nonce,
   one-way encryption function, password, replay attack and salt.
   Readers not familiar with these terms should use that glossary as a
   reference.  Other terms defined in [RFC5802] are also used in this
   document.

2.2.  Notation

   This document reuses notation defined in SCRAM.

3.  SCRAM Extension for 2FA

   This extension doesn't add any extra roundtrips to SCRAM
   authentication.  SCRAM was designed to be extensible, so it allows
   for optional and mandatory attributes, which covered by MAC codes.
   Second "factors" are conveyed in the second message ("client-final-
   message-without-proof" ABNF production) sent from the client to the
   server.

   This extension doesn't change how the client authenticates the
   server.  This extension also doesn't cover enrollment with a 2FA
   system, such enrollment happends out-of-band.

   The server authenticates the client after receiving the second
   message as described in Section 3 of [RFC5802] If the client included
   "type" and "second-factor" attributes defined in this document (see
   Section 5) and the server supports the specified second factor type,



Melnikov                  Expires 17 July 2023                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            SCRAM 2FA extensions              January 2023


   the server verifies content of the "second-factor" according to the
   "type".  If the second factor verification fails, the server MUST
   fail authentication and SHOULD return either "replayed-second-factor"
   or "invalid-second-factor" error in the "e" attribute.  [[It would be
   possible to make the extra attributes mandatory by using SCRAM's
   "m=", but the text above doesn't do that.  This is one of open issues
   to resolve.]]

4.  SCRAM Extension for reauthentication

   This reauthentication extension to SCRAM allows the server to return
   a token that can be used for quick reauthentication and bypasses 2
   factor authentication prompt to the user.  The reauthentication token
   is a randomly generated value.The reauthentication token is returned
   in the "o" attribute that is appended to the end of the "server-
   final-message".

   [[Note: it would be possible to extend SCRAM itself to do
   reauthentication, by including an earlier received reauthentication
   token in the "client-first-message" of a subsequent SCRAM
   authentication.  This will also turn off the server checking for 2
   factor authentication information, unless the reauthentication
   attempt is rejected by the server.  In the meantime, this document
   presents a couple of other alternatives on how to use other SASL
   mechanisms with the reauthentication token.]]

   When the HT-* mechanism [draft-schmaus-kitten-sasl-ht] is used for
   the reauthentication after a successful SCRAM authentication, the
   reauthentication token is the SASL-HT token (see
   [draft-schmaus-kitten-sasl-ht]).  [[Note that the HT hash should
   probably match the SCRAM hash used or "be better".]]

   When the CLIENT-KEY/CLIENT-KEY-PLUS mechanism (see draft-cridland-
   kitten-clientkey) is used for the reauthentication after a successful
   SCRAM authentication, the reauthentication token is the Client Secret
   Key.  [[Need to also somehow convey token expiration?]]

5.  Formal Syntax

   This document defines the following new SCRAM attributes:

   *  t: This attribute specifies the type of second factor.  This
      document defines two possible types: "totp" (see Section 6) and
      "ctap1" (see Section 8).  If this attribute is specified, the "f"
      attribute MUST also be specified.

Internet-Draft            SCRAM 2FA extensions              January 2023


   *  f: This attribute specifies the value of the second factor.  For
      "t=totp" it is 6 digit decimal number.  [[Use 8 digits per Rick
      van Rein?]] This attribute MUST be ignored unless the "t"
      attribute is also specified.

   *  l: This attribute is used by some second factors (e.g.  CTAP1) to
      specify the challenge returned by the SCRAM server.

   *  o: This attribute specifies the base64-encoded value of the
      reauthentication token.

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].

   type            = "t=" type-value
                 ; Complies with "attr-val" syntax.
                 ; Returned in client-final-message.
   type-value      = "totp" / "ctap1" / value
                 ; Type of second factor.
                 ; Should be registered with IANA.
   second-factor   = "f=" second-factor-value
                 ; Complies with "attr-val" syntax.
                 ; Returned in client-final-message.
   second-factor-value = 6DIGIT / value
                 ; 6DIGIT when "t=totp".
   server-challenge = "l=" base64
                 ; Data returned by SCRAM server in server-first-message
                 ; to be used for construction of second-factor-value.

   server-error-value-ext =
           "replayed-second-factor" /
           "invalid-second-factor" /
           "second-factor-value-missing"

   value = <as defined in RFC 5802>


   reauth-token = "o=" base64
                  ; base64 encoding of reauthentication
                  ; token.
                  ; Returned in server-final-message.


6.  Use of TOTP with SCRAM

   When TOTP is used with SCRAM, the following values for "t" and "f"
   attributes (see Section 5 for their generic syntax) are used:




Melnikov                  Expires 17 July 2023                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            SCRAM 2FA extensions              January 2023


   *  t: This attribute specifies the type of second factor.  For TOTP
      the value is "totp".  If this attribute is specified, the "f"
      attribute MUST also be specified.

   *  f: This attribute specifies the value of the second factor.  For
      "t=totp" it is 6 digit decimal number.  This attribute MUST be
      ignored unless the "t" attribute is also specified.

   A TOTP URI is specified with the following ABNF:

   totp-uri = "otpauth" "://" "totp/" label "?secret=" secret
              "&issuer=" issuer
   label = issuer (":" / "%3A") identity
   identity = 1*CHAR ; URI-encoded SASL identity
   secret = 40 * HEXCHAR ; Base32 (hex) encoded secret with no padding.
   issuer = 1*CHAR ; Issuer name.


7.  Example

   The following example extends the example from Section 5 of [RFC5802]
   to demonstrate use of TOTP:

     C: n,,n=user,r=fyko+d2lbbFgONRv9qkxdawL
     S: r=fyko+d2lbbFgONRv9qkxdawL3rfcNHYJY1ZVvWVs7j,s=QSXCR+Q6sek8bf92,
        i=4096
     C: c=biws,r=fyko+d2lbbFgONRv9qkxdawL3rfcNHYJY1ZVvWVs7j,
        t=totp,f=776804,p=v0X8v3Bz2T0CJGbJQyF0X+HI4Ts=
     S: v=lz59pqV8S7suAoZWja4dJRkFsKQ=


   Please note that TOTP extension described in this document works in
   the same way with SCRAM-SHA-256/SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-512/
   SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS or any other SCRAM variants that use other hash
   functions.

8.  Use of FIDO CTAP1/U2F with SCRAM

   Note that this section describes steps to achieve Client-to-
   Authenticator Protocols v1 (CTAP1)/U2F 2FA in terms of CTAP2 API.

   When FIDO CTAP1/U2F is used with SCRAM, the following values for "t",
   "l" and "f" attributes (see Section 5 for their generic syntax) are
   used:

   *  t: This attribute specifies the type of second factor.  For FIDO
      CTAP1/U2F the value is "ctap1".  If this attribute is specified,
      the "f" attribute MUST also be specified.

Internet-Draft            SCRAM 2FA extensions              January 2023


   *  l: base64-encoded challenge as returned by SCRAM server.

   *  f: This attribute specifies the value of the second factor.  For
      "t=ctap1" it is the CBOR-serialized value of
      authenticatorGetAssertionResponse map described below.  This
      attribute MUST be ignored unless the "t" attribute is also
      specified.

   SCRAM client sends U2F_AUTHENTICATE command formatted as specified in
   [FIDO-U2F-Raw-Message-Formats] to the authenticator (e.g. a USB or
   NFC device).

   The "P1" framing parameter to U2F_AUTHENTICATE is a single octet
   parameter defined as follows:

   *  If "up" is set to false, set it to 0x08 (dont-enforce-user-
      presence-and-sign).

   *  For USB, set it to 0x07 (check-only).  This should prevent call
      getting blocked on waiting for user input.  If response returns
      success, then call again setting the enforce-user-presence-and-
      sign.

   *  For NFC, set it to 0x03 (enforce-user-presence-and-sign).  The tap
      has already provided the presence and won't block.

   The "P2" framing parameter to U2F_AUTHENTICATE is a single octet that
   always has the value 0x00.

   The "request-data" framing parameter (u2fAuthenticateRequest) to
   U2F_AUTHENTICATE is constructed as follows:

   *  The clientData structure (see Section 5.8.1 of [W3C_webauthn_3])
      is filled in as follows:

      -  The "type" field has value "webauthn.get".

      -  The "challenge" field contains the base64url encoding of the
         challenge provided by the Relying Party.  This is the value of
         the "l" attribute described above.  (Note, possibly need to
         base64-decode and base64url-encode.)

      -  The "origin" field contains the origin of the SCRAM client in
         the format specified in [RFC6454], for example
         "smtp://client.example.net:587".

      -  Other fields are specified in Section 5.8.1 of
         [W3C_webauthn_3].

      respectively.  Set all other bits of flags to zero.  Note: bit
      zero is the least significant bit.  See also Authenticator Data
      section of [W3C_webauthn_3].

   *  Let signCount be a 4-byte unsigned integer initialized with CTAP1/

   Let authenticatorGetAssertionResponse be a CBOR map with the
   following keys whose values are as follows:

   *  Set 0x01 with the credential from allowList that whose response
      succeeded.

   *  Set 0x02 with authenticatorData bytes.

   *  Set 0x03 with signature field from CTAP1/U2F authentication
      response message.  Note: An ASN.1-encoded ECDSA signature value
      ranges over 8-72 bytes in length.

9.  Open Issues

   Simon Josefsson: should this be a new SASL mechanism name, e.g.
   CROTP-SHA-256?

   Should we pick between TOTP and FIDO2 (CTAP1)?

   Rick van Rein: specify a HOTP variant as well?

   Rick van Rein: use TOTP with 6 or 8 digits?  Register both variants?

10.  Security Considerations

   Unless an external security layer (such as TLS) is also used, the OTP
   value is sent in unencrypted/unhashed form from the client to the
   server, which allows an attacker to read the OTP value and perform a
   race with the server to validate the OTP.

   TBD

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the definition of the SASL family SCRAM
   in the SASL Mechanism registry established by [RFC4422] to also point
   to this document.

   IANA is also requested to create a new subregistry of "SASL
   mechanism" for registering second factor schemes used in the "t"
   attribute as specified in this document.

   The registration template is as follows:


   SCRAM Second Factor Scheme Name:
   Pointer to specification text:
   Notes (optional):


   The registration procedure for the above subregistry is Expert
   Review.

   IANA is requested to register a new value in the subregistry defined
   above:


   SCRAM Second Factor Scheme Name: TOTP
   Pointer to specification text: [[ this document ]]
   Notes (optional): (none)
