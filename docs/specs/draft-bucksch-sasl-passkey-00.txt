1.  Introduction

   Introduces a SASL mechanism that allows the user to authenticate
   using a FIDO2 Passkey.

   The client/server exchange is a simple challenge-response mechanism,
   using the same mechanism that browsers use when they authenticate
   using Passkeys to a website.

2.  Creation of the Passkey

   The Passkey has to be created on the user's device via other means.
   Signup and passkey creation happens, for example, at the normal web
   frontend of the site.

   We assume that the browser will use the same authenticator (OS
   functions) as the authenticating application.  The authenticator is
   responsible for creating and storing the Passkey.  The authenticator
   may also sync the Passkey between the user's devices.  The Passkey is
   never seen by either browser nor the authenticating application, but
   managed entirely by the Passkey manager.

2.1.  Initial Auth using Passkey

   1.  The authenticating application has the target server hostname and
       authentication identity (e.g. username or email address)
       configured.  If the target server is an IMAP server, the username
       is the email address.  If the target server is an XMPP server,
       the username is the XMPP address of the user.

   2.  The authenticating application opens (or reuses existing)
       connection to the target server and starts authentication using
       the SASL PASSKEY mechanism.  PASSKEY mechanism starts with the
       client sending the initial client response, which has the
       following format defined using ABNF:

   passkey-client-step1 = authentication_id
   authentication_id    = 1*OCTET

   3.  a.  The server generates a Passkey challenge, based on the target
   server hostname, authentication identity, and Passkey of the user,
   and sends the server challenge with to the client.

   b.  If login for that user is forbidden, the server will return a
   SASL error.  A human-readable error message for end users must be
   included, with a detailed and helpful description of why login is
   forbidden for that user, and instructions for the user how the
   situation can be remedied.

   4.  The authenticating application takes the challenge and passes it
   on as-is to the OS authenticator API, which returns the response.
   The OS calls are the same that the web browser would do.

   As part of this process, the OS authenticator API may require the end
   user to complete additional authentication, for example entering a
   device unlock code, providing a fingerprint, face recognition, or
   similar.  This is the responsibility of the OS authenticator and
   outside the scope of this protocol.

   The authenticating application then passes on the response as-is to
   the server.

   5.  a.  If the server accepts the response as valid and allows login,
   it responds with a SASL success response.  The user is logged in.

   b.  If the response is invalid, the server responds with a SASL error
   and a human-readable error message for the end user.

   server-final-message = server-error "," server-error-message
           ; Only returned on error. Omitted on success.

   server-error = "e=" server-error-value

   server-error-value = "invalid-encoding" /
                        "unknown-user" /
                        "invalid-username-encoding" /
                          ; invalid username encoding (invalid UTF-8 or
                          ; SASLprep failed)
                        "other-error" /
                        server-error-value-ext
           ; Unrecognized errors should be treated as "other-error".
           ; In order to prevent information disclosure, the server
           ; may substitute the real reason with "other-error".

   server-error-value-ext = value
           ; Additional error reasons added by extensions
           ; to this document.

   server-error-message = "m=" server-error-message-value

   server-error-message-value = 1*OCTET
           ; Human readable error message in UTF-8

   This SASL mechanims will typically be combined with SASL chain or
   SASL2, to allow re-opening a new connection without requiring the
   user to go through Passkey authentication again.

3.  IMAP Example

   In IMAP, the exchange would be:

   S: * OK ACME IMAP Server v1.23 is ready
   C: 22 CAPABILITY
   S: 22 CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 IMAP4rev2 AUTH=PASSKEY AUTH=REMEMBERME
   C: 23 AUTHENTICATE PASSKEY eW91QGV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg==
   S: AEC6576576557=== (passkey challenge)
   C: EAB675757GJvYgB== (passkey response)
   S: 23 OK AUTHENTICATE completed

   Where "eW91QGV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg==" is base64-encoded authentication
   identity ("you@example.com"), "AEC6576576557===" is base64-encoded
   passkey challenge, "EAB675757GJvYgB==" is base64-encoded passkey
   response.  All challenge and responses values are base64-encoded
   according to the IMAP SASL protocol profile.
