Abstract

   This document updates RFC4121 with support for encryption mechanisms
   that can authenticate associated data such as Counter with CBC-MAC
   (CCM) and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).  These mechanisms are often more
   performant and need not expand the message as much as conventional
   modes.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates [RFC4121] with support for encryption
   mechanisms that support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
   (AEAD).  These mechanisms often have performance advantage over
   conventional encryption modes as they can be efficiently parallelized
   and do not expand the plaintext when encrypting.

   In addition, this document defines new GSS-API functions for
   protecting associated data in addition to a plaintext.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) Overview

   The Kerberos 5 GSS-API mechanism specified in [RFC4121] provides for
   the authenticated encryption of plaintext, that is, it provides both
   for confidentiality and a way to check the for integrity and
   authenticity.

   It can be useful in many applications to provide for the integrity
   and authenticity of some additional unencrypted data; this is termed
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  This can be
   done by the generic composition of existing encryption and checksum
   mechanisms, or using algorithms which specifically provide for AEAD
   (see [RFC5116]).  The latter class of algorithms, referred to as
   native AEAD, may have additional constraints (further described in
   [KRB-AEAD]).

4.  Updates to RFC 2743

   [RFC2743] is updated with variations of GSS_Wrap() and GSS_Unwrap()
   that permit the inclusion of associated data to be authenticated
   along with a plaintext.


   // TBD: do we allow interleaved plaintext and associated data (which
   // SSPI does and indeed requires for DCE), or do we limit it to a
   // single octet string each?  If the former, we need to define
   // GSS_Wrap_IOV instead of GSS_Wrap_AEAD (and the Unwrap
   // equivalents).

4.1.  GSS_Wrap_AEAD

   Inputs:

   *  context_handle CONTEXT HANDLE,

   *  conf_req_flag BOOLEAN,

   *  qop_req INTEGER, -- 0 specifies default QOP

   *  input_assoc_data OCTET STRING, -- associated data

   *  input_message OCTET STRING -- plaintext

   Outputs:

   *  major_status INTEGER,

   *  minor_status INTEGER,

   *  conf_state BOOLEAN,

   *  output_message OCTET STRING -- caller must release with
      GSS_Release_buffer()

Internet-Draft       AEAD Modes for Kerberos GSS-API        January 2023


   Performs the data origin authentication, data integrity and
   (optionally) data confidentiality functions of GSS_Wrap(),
   additionally integrity protecting the data in input_assoc_data.
   Return values are as for GSS_Wrap().  Note that output_message does
   not include the data in input_assoc_data.

4.2.  GSS_Unwrap_AEAD

   Inputs:

   *  context_handle CONTEXT HANDLE,

   *  input_message OCTET STRING, -- plaintext

   *  input_assoc_data OCTET STRING -- associated data

   Outputs:

   *  conf_state BOOLEAN,

   *  qop_state INTEGER,

   *  major_status INTEGER,

   *  minor_status INTEGER,

   *  output_message OCTET STRING -- caller must release with
      GSS_Release_buffer()

   Processes a data element generated (and optionally encrypted) by
   GSS_Wrap(), provided as input_message, additionally validating the
   data origin and integrity of input_assoc_data.  Return values are as
   for GSS_Unwrap().  Note that output_message does not include the data
   in input_assoc_data.

5.  Updates to RFC 4121

5.1.  Support for Associated Data

   The generation of per-message tokens using the GSS_Wrap_AEAD() and
   GSS_Unwrap_AEAD() functions is identical to GSS_Wrap() and
   GSS_Unwrap(), except that:

   *  the encrypt-with-ad and decrypt-with-ad functions are used instead
      of the encrypt and decrypt functions (respectively)

   *  the input_assoc_data parameter is passed as the associated data

Internet-Draft       AEAD Modes for Kerberos GSS-API        January 2023


   *  the is-longterm parameter is always false

5.2.  Existing Encryption Types

   For existing encryption mechanisms that use a generic composition of
   encryption and checksum functions (such as the Simplified Profile in
   [RFC3961]), the only operative difference to [RFC4121] is that the
   associated data is prepended to the plaintext before invoking the
   checksum function.  As such, for these encryption types
   GSS_Wrap_AEAD() with no associated data has an identical output to
   GSS_Wrap().

5.3.  Native AEAD Encryption Types

   When used with native AEAD encryption types as defined in [KRB-AEAD],
   the generation of [RFC4121] per-message tokens is modified as
   described below.

5.3.1.  Restriction on Native AEAD Usage

   Implementations SHALL NOT use native AEAD encryption types where the
   deterministic cipherstate length is less than 12 octets (96 bytes).


   // TBD: if we want to support CCM with a 32-bit counter, we could
   // remove the Filler byte and reduce the required cipherstate length
   // to 11 octets.  However, this may make it more difficult to use
   // TLS-oriented CCM implementations that expose the Fixed-Common and
   // Fixed-Distinct nonce components independently.

   Native AEAD encryption types not supporting long-term keys MUST NOT
   be used as ticket session keys, only as authenticator subkeys.
   [RFC4537] SHOULD be used to indicate initiator support.

5.3.2.  Application-provided Cipherstate

   The cipherstate for each invocation of encrypt-with-ad or decrypt-
   with-ad is given as follows.  (For consistency with [RFC4121] the
   following definition uses 0-based indexing.)

            |   12..   |         | Remaining octets (if any) |
            |          |         |      are set to zero      |
            +----------+---------+---------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   The output cipherstate from the encrypt-with-ad and decrypt-with-ad
   functions is discarded as it is always specified explicitly as
   described above.

   The use of application-managed cipherstate allows the per-message
   token size be reduced by omitting the confounder and encrypted copy
   of the token header.  There is no limit on the number or size of
   messages that can be protected beyond those imposed by the sequence
   number size and the underlying cryptosystem.

5.3.3.  Encryption and Checksum Operations

   This text amends [RFC4121] Section 4.2.4.

   In Wrap tokens that provide for confidentiality, the first 16 octets
   of the token (the "header", as defined in [RFC4121] Section 4.2.6)
   SHALL NOT be appended to the plaintext data before encryption.
   Instead, the TOK_ID, Flags and SND_SEQ fields of the token header are
   protected by the initialization vector (cipherstate).  The EC field
   is unprotected, a change from [RFC4121].  For the native AEAD
   encryption types profiled in [KRB-AEAD] Section 5, EC SHALL be zero
   (except when GSS_C_DCE_STYLE is in use, see below).  This
   specification does not support native AEAD encryption types that
   require the plaintext to be padded.

Internet-Draft       AEAD Modes for Kerberos GSS-API        January 2023


   In Wrap tokens that do not provide for confidentiality, the first 16
   octets of the token SHALL NOT be appended to the to-be-signed
   plaintext data.  As with Wrap tokens that do provide for
   confidentiality, all fields except EC and RRC are protected by the
   initialization vector.  For the AEAD encryption types defined in
   [KRB-AEAD] Section 5, EC SHALL be sixteen, reflecting the tag length
   of 16 octets (128 bits).

   The receiver MUST explicitly validate the EC field.  Owing to this
   specification not supporting native AEAD encryption types that
   require padding and protecting the token header with the
   initialization vector, all encryption can be done in-place and there
   is no need to rotate the emitted token (see [RFC4121] Section 4.2.5).
   As such the RRC field SHALL contain the hex value 00 00.

   Because native AEAD encryption types lack an explicit checksum
   operation, MIC tokens are generated similarly to Wrap tokens, using
   the encrypt-with-ad function passing the to-be-signed data as the
   associated data and using a plaintext length of zero.  The key usage
   and initialization vector serve to disambiguate MIC from Wrap tokens.
   The octet string output by the encrypt-with-ad function contains the
   authentication tag, which is placed in the SGN_CKSUM field of the
   token.

5.3.4.  DCE RPC Interoperability

   Existing implementations that support the GSS_C_DCE_STYLE context
   flag will, when this flag is in set, set EC for Wrap tokens with
   confidentiality to the underlying cipher's block size and use an
   effective Right Rotation Count (RRC) of EC + RRC bytes.  This
   document does not specify otherwise.

   When GSS_C_DCE_STYLE is set, receivers MUST verify that the otherwise
   unprotected EC field is the underlying cipher's block size for Wrap
   tokens with confidentiality.  (For Wrap tokens without
   confidentiality, the EC field remains the length of the
   authentication tag.)

   DCE interleaves plaintext and associated data; because native AEAD
   algorithms may require associated data to be processed before any
   plaintext, any plaintext and associated data must each be coalesced
   before encrypting or decrypting.  This document does not specify an
   API for processing interleaved plaintext and associated data.

6.  Security Considerations

   The combination of a context-specific session key and the presence of
   the the TOK_ID and SND_SEQ fields in the cipherstate guarantees that
   the key/IV combination is safe from reuse.  The allows native AEAD
   modes such as [GCM] and [CCM] to be used securely.

   Because the initialization vector has a deterministic (but non-
   repeating) construction, it is safe for use with GCM without any
   limitation on the number of invocations of the authenticated
   encryption function other than that imposed by the requirement that
   the cipherstate not repeat.  (Section 8.3 of [GCM] imposes an
   invocation limit of 2^32 where the cipherstate is randomly generated
   or is a length other than 96 bits.)

   When using native AEAD encryption types, the EC and RRC fields are
   unprotected, however they are well known constants which can be
   validated by the peer.

   The reordering of plaintext and associated data for GSS_C_DCE_STYLE
   interoperability may be problematic where the plaintext and
   associated data lengths are variable.
