              <h2>Overview of Additional UnboundID-Specific Functionality</h2>

              <p>
                The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java provides a significant amount of additional
                functionality that is available for use when the SDK is used to communicate with
                an instance of the Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661
                Directory Server.  This page describes that additional functionality.
              </p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Additional Controls</h3>

              <p>
                The following additional controls are available when communicating with a

                <li>
                  <b>Account Usability Control</b> -- Provides information about whether a
                  specified user account is available for use, and if not information about why it

                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Administrative Operation Control</b> -- Indicates that the associated request
                  is intended for some administrative purpose rather than a general application
                  request.  Operations with this control may be treated specially by the server,
                  including placing additional information in access log messages and excluding
                  them from inclusion in response time histogram tracking.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                  considered read-only) as part of the server schema.

                  <b>Get Server ID Control</b> -- Provides a way for the client to request
                  information about which server was actually used to process a request (including

                  may be used in conjunction with the route to server request control to request
                  that an operation be processed by a specific server.

                  <b>Intermediate Client Control</b> -- May be used to help track requests and
                  responses through a directory environment (e.g., between a client, a directory
                  proxy server, and a directory server).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>

                  associated operation.
                  <br><br>

                  shutting down and all outstanding requests are being canceled).
                  <br><br>
